**Gdude**: 5 minutes of so, make sure that more participants are able to join. But before all that it's time to get Craig-ed. We're now being Craig-ed. 

Quet'd? (T/N: Quilt + Beta) I said Craig-ed. I'll explain that in a minute. Craig and Giarg?

Are you in here, **Kroppeb**? Are you able to join the stage on your own, or do I need to pull you up? OK, how about now? Nice, hi **Kroppeb**. Before we get started, I'd like to ask all participants to join the stage. You all need to be up here because of how we've got this setup. I'll try to drag people up but I might miss some.

How many do we have? 14?

Beta buzz, guys. It's almost time to get started. Alrighty. Well, welcome to the stage everyone. I'm assuming we don't have a full set of participants, but I assume they'll be in and out. I assume everyone can hear my cough, OK.

Alrighty. So we're just going to start off going who's on stage at the moment and what we do. I know a couple of you don't have microphones and that's fine. I know most people know who I am as community manager. **Octal** is part of our team, doing events. **Alizée** is another one of our moderators working hard to put this together. **CheaterCodes** do you want to go over what you do?

**CheaterCodes**: I'm a developer working mainly on CHASM and Build Tools. I've been working on mappings stuff too.

**Kroppeb**: I'm **Kroppeb**. I help out with CHASM and Decompilers.

**AlexIIL**: I'm **AlexIIL**. I work on Quilt Loader mostly.

**LambdAurora**: Hi, I'm **LambdAurora**. I'm a developer and mainly a QSL core maintainer, and also part of the Mappings Team. 

**Gdude**: Thank you very much. You're a little bit quiet there, I assume it's just microphone distance though. Right then, let's get started shall we? We have a set of questions picked up from our Google Form. It's been posted in our `#announcements` chat for a few days. I'm going to pick a few questions, and then pick one of you to answer it. The other, we'll do a sort of round-table format.

"What does Quilt entering Beta actually mean?""

**CheaterCodes**: That's a big question really. In short, Quilt Beta was a target for developers to get stuff going so that the community can do something with Quit and we can get feedback. So we set a deadline to make it public so that we can't just keep pushing it off. For most of the community it means that you can use Quilt to code mods. So use Quilt Mappings on QSL on Quilt Loader. So Quilt Mappings has been out now for how long?

**Gdude**: A few months, really. 

"So what would you say are the next things to be worked on during Beta?" At least on your end.

**CheaterCodes**: I guess if you don't speak to a person specifically, I'll just speak again. For me, it's mostly CHASM. I want to get CHASM working. In a modding environment it means get it running on Quilt Loader, running on Loom. Mixins is a bigger project.

**Gdude**: I've certainly seen a few projects people worked on post-Beta. The installer is a big one. Not a big one but definitely needs doing. **Zoe** is working on the erorrs, or making the errors look nicer. Not sure of the other teams, but does anyone else need anything that needs looking at after the start of Beta?

**AlexIIL**: For Quilt Loader, it's to make sure that it's running and can handle most situations fairly well, rather than having work that needs to be done on it.

**CheaterCodes**: Mappings, we really want it to get working on the fully automatic-updating as well. The updating of mappings is being done every week without much human input, so we're hoping to change that really soon.

**Gdude**: Alright, let's move onto a round-table format.

"What was the hardest moment in quilt's development for you?"

**CheaterCodes**: The hardest moment? Every time I work on Gradle, I guess. I guess that's the correct answer. If they want to talk about something that is related to production, then I don't know. CHASM has been fairly smooth other than some really hard thinking at the start. But once that was done it was really easy so far.

**Gdude**: That's good. Certainly seems there was a lot less friction than we expected with it. **Kroppeb**, your turn.

**Kroppeb**: I don't know really. ????

**CheaterCodes**: Just say more about the CHASM thing. Say more about the terminology while talking about it for 3 hrs. Just use different words.

**Gdude**: I guess. **AlexIIL**?

**AlexIIL**: The most difficult part was keeping it upstream to keep it compatible with Fabric. **Glitch** did most of that, but the work still had to be done.

**Gdude**: **LambdAurora**? No, do we have microphone death? Yep. She'll be back in a minute. Welcome back.

**LambdAurora**: It was mostly Quilted Fabric API. Because for a long while I was the only one maintaining it and it was quite difficult. Otherwise it was and it still is mapping as a process. Because porting the mappings to a new version is still kind of difficult because we're using kind of sketchy tools as well. But IDK really what else.

**Gdude**: That's alright. OK, the next question I have is another round-table.

"What is or was your favorite part of Quilt to work on?"

**CheaterCodes**: My favorite part? I'd think Gradle, but it's both true and wrong. It's really annoying to work with, but I like the challenge. I don't know, so it's a love-hate relationship. CHASM was actually quite fun, once you got past the complicated stuff. There were a lot of challenge, but most of them with really smooth ???. CHASM-Lang also, in general.

**AlexIIL**: Probably Quiltflower, because it's like a huge codebase and every time you go into it, you find new stuff to discover. It's kind of like a complex puzzle that neds fixing in places.

**LambdAurora**: My favorite part, I would say, I have not a lot of favorite parts. I would say first is when we switched to using Mumble for meetings. My other favorite parts is when ?? become usable and when Recipe API got merged.

"Why release Quilt on Apr 20th?"

**Gdude**: It's a Beta release rather than a stable release, let's make that clear. But coincidentally the day we opened this to the public was 4/20 last year. So I figured it was a good date to open the Beta after a year. But a lot of people ???

**CheaterCodes**: To be fair, one of the reasons I voted for the date was because it was easy to remember. Some people wanted to push it back to So as to or Sun, but 4/20 is so easy to remember every year. If you want anniversaries, it's easy to remember. Funny number is easy to remember, so that's good.

"How or why did you get involved with Quilt in the first place?"

**Gdude**: I actually didn't hear about Quilt until after a couple of months after the project started. This kind of surprises a lot of people because I kind of ended up being the face of it. But the reason I become the community manager is because people asked me to do it, and that's why.

**Octal**/Tubbo, you said you wanted to answer this one?

I think Discord is just fighting with our microphones today. That's alright, we'll continue on until you figure out your microphone issues.

**Alizée**: Can you hear me? Mostly it was just **Gdude** talking about this thing called Quilt over and over again in community servers, so I thought, what is Quilt. It seemed like an interesting project so I got involved.

**CheaterCodes**: I don't really know, to be honest. I wasn't there at the very start. But I heard about it I think, maybe like day 2 or 3 of the Discord server after going public. After that I tried looking at the toolchain and sniffing around.

**Gdude**: "This is my project."

**CheaterCodes**: Well, **EarthComputer** started on this project and I kind of picked it up.

**Gdude**: As always.

**Octal**: I was- The reason I got introduced- I got started with Quilt stuff was that I was relatively new to modding at the time. And I had heard about Quilt and the people behind it, and I thought, yeah, I agree with that. And when the Quilt Discord server become public, it become one of my favorite communities, and I applied to become a community manager.

**Southpaw**: "Even though I'm not on the stage, I want to answer this:
I got an invite to Quilt in **gdude**'s now dead Fabric Community server and a few months down the line decided to apply for moderation :pineapple:"

**Kroppeb**: I think my story is mostly the same as Octal?

**LambdAurora**: So for me I have a history with Fabric. Because I was involved in Woven, which kind of was like Quilt but also different. It was not successful but it led to some interesting stuff. I think involving stuff and some dislike of Fabric that started to settle in myself. Then suddenly in Mar of last year, I get a message from **SuperCoder79** inviting me to the famous Quilt Initiative Discord server, which was ???, and that's how I got involved.

**Gdude**: Thank you. I see **snoozestudios** has decided to drop in.

**snoozestudios**: I think I just saw it in various different modding communities, and I thought it looked interesting. Then I thought it look interesting and decided to join. Not as interesting as the rest of you.

**AlexIIL**: I'd been looking to improve Buildcraft. First I went to Fabric, but there were a few controversies that I won't go into. Then I moved to Quilt, mostly because a few people I worked with moved to Quilt. Though I was there from the beginning.

**Gdude**: There's a few questions next. 

"Official Quilt example mod when?"

Hopefully today. It's one of the things I've been waiting on before making an announcement. Oh, I've been pinged. It's been done apparently. Nobody told me that. There's a link in the chat.

(**Octal**: "It is ready, [GitHub ing QuiltMC/quiltingexamplingmod: Official Quilt example mod.](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltingexamplingmod "https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltingexamplingmod")")

"Is there Quilt-Fabric link?"

I was hoping **Glitch** would be here. Patchwork will be a thing. Loader plugins would make loading Fabric a lot more feasible on Quilt. Something is coming, not from us, but it's coming. **CheaterCodes**, maybe you want to answer this for variety.

"Why don't we keep backwards compatibility with Fabric?"

**CheaterCodes**: I guess I haven't been talking enough yet. That's cute. The answer to that is, we do. In general, we don't have a deadline of "We must support Quilt instead of a Fabric version for one year or something". We just don't want to have to support Fabric, only as long as it benefits us. Hopefully Quilt will become the bigger modloader, and then there'll be no reason to support a modloader that's smaller. Evidently that's not true now, but when it is, we'll drop Fabric.

I guess this is for **LambdAurora**. 

"Why do we need QSL as an extra mod even though we also need Quilt Loader?"

**Gdude**: I guess **LambdAurora** is having microphone problems again.

**LambdAurora**: Oh no, I just got confused by the question. The reason is simple. The modloader is made to work across a lot of different MC versions at once. While QSL is made for only one. It'll update with every version of MC. There'll always be something that breaks it. So making it ??? is much better because it requires much less of the Quilt Loader and stuff. Otherwise- For now it's an extra mod, and it's similar to how Fabric has Fabric API and the Fabric Loader split. For example, Forge too tries to work towards a split like that. Because it's just much more easier to manage. And also kind of easier for everyone to maintain.

"When do you plan to work on docs and when will they replace the Fabric one?"

Docs are kind of split into two parts. First is for developers. We do have docs for QSL, they's not on Maven but they'll get there soon. As for something like Fabric wiki, **OroArmor** has been working on something like that. He'll be there in about 30 seconds. Just got confirmation, he'll be over to tell us more about that. As for user documentation, I would hope to expand those to a proper wiki as well, but we still have work to do on those.

**OroArmor**: Yes, so for the Developer Wiki, a lot of people have expressed their issues with how the Fabric wiki is formated, how the code is outdated, written for 1.15 but now it's 1.18. So for the Developer Wiki, the code has to be able to compile, since the code is actual, real code that is used to explain what's going on. Beyond that I haven't done too much prototyping. Basically it's one massive Gradle project that turned into a webpage based on what I've done so far. It should be better than Fabric wiki, and better than Forge wiki so that we have the best wiki of all the modloaders.

**Gdude**: Lofty goals but I'm sure you can get there. I think this one is for you too.

"Compared to other modding platforms like Forge, Fabric, Sponge, etc, what would you summarise Quilt's value proposition as?"

What do you think of this **OroArmor**? I guess it's asking what we have over them.

**OroArmor**: Quilt is somewhere between Forge and Fabric. Forge is very strict, API is practially forced. They've started moving away from that with their loader. ??? Fabric has a flexible API. Benefit of strong central API with Forge but a lot of the flexibility that Fabric provides. Some of the other developers you can try to say something.

**Gdude**: I would say CHASM would be a big part of Quilt's value proposition when it comes around.

**CheaterCodes**: I hope so. It's a bit awkward because just saying CHASM, to most people it's just confusing. But basically the goal is to allow the community to make something like Mixin Extras, [which allows you] to make something completely new without requiring ??? in Loader. You don't have to wait for us to provide loader injection, you can just do it yourself. Which I think is really important for long-term maintenance.

Alright, next question then. 

"If you had to give one reason why to choose Quilt over another modloader?" 

That sounds like an admin question to me, **OroArmor**.

**OroArmor**: So, from a player perspective, theoretically there should be very little change. It should feel like Fabric, to the point where you can take your favourite Fabric pack and mod up. We're not quite there yet, because some modders use interesting ways to get their mods working. You also, as a player, should hopefully be able to understand the issues better, especially surrounding modloading. Some people have expressed concerns over Fabric's- If you're missing a mod, that loading screen can be confusing for new players. So hopefully Quilt's screen is a lot more descriptive and easier to understand.

For developers, we hope to have a larger API than Fabric. So take Fabric API and expand and improve on that. So a lot of the modules in QSL are practically 1-to-1 with Fabric and have extra stuff on top of them. Then, Quilt Mappings are a lot clearer. Fabric has a cleanroom policy, so ????, makes it a lot harder to get help for cross-platform work. Quilt mappings got rid of the cleanroom policy, ???.

A lot of the constants in the game are a lot harder to figure out, but with Mojmap we can now see what that is

**CheaterCodes**: I think the question was a bit mis-understood. I think it was about one thing.

**OroArmor**: The #1 thing for a player-

**CheaterCodes**: I think the answer for a player should be fairly easy: Better mods. Because we are mostly developer-focused, and from the Quilt developer side, most of the Quilt developers are mod developers, so obviously targeting a lot of things better for mod developers. So anything that makes things better for mod developers make it eventually better for players.

**Gdude**: I've been suspiciously tagged in. 

"Will it come to MultiMC?"

**Peterix** said that he'll consider merging it when it become a bit more popular. I think it's still possible to get Quilt working if you're on the special instance. If you're on the Toolchain Server, I think there's a special instance pinned, but you have to get the JSON set up which is kind of a pain. 

If you're looking for an alternative, you can use PolyMC (T/N: A recent MultiMC fork) but I know that some people are unhappy with that. We're aiming for launcher coverage so hopefully we'll see.

This is an interesting one, but I'll excuse myself. 

"If you could bring a shulker box of items from Minecraft into the real world from survival, what would you bring?"

**AlexIIL**: Oh, that's a difficult question. I guess 27 stacks of gold blocks is an easy one. Or maybe gold ingots, they would be easier to sell. 

**Gdude**: Modded items?

**AlexIIL**: Too many possibilities. A lot of fun in the real world, but also dangerous. Ender portals would be a bit dangerous, going to hell and all. I don't think Minecraft is suited the real world. (T/N: Probably meant Nether portals instead.) 

**Gdude**: I think most answers would be some variation of gold or diamonds.

**snoozestudios**: Elytra and fireworks seem fun. Enchanting table too. Put a pencil inside and get Unbreaking 5 on it. Oh, it neds to break though.

**CheaterCodes**: If you wear pants, you should put Mending on it or something.

**LambdAurora**: 27 items is quite a lot. One thing I would bring is a trident. I think I would bring a bucket of axolotl. And a shulker box of shulker shells, to make more shulker boxes. The question is whether I can craft stuff with what I bring or not. 

**Gdude**: But I believe that was the case, though it's not mentioned.

**LambdAurora**: I would bring wood blocks, shulker shells to craft more shulker boxes. Then if my real life inventory was as bad as Minecraft's inventory- 

**CheaterCodes**: It says no crafting allowed.

**LambdAurora**: Oh, then a bundle, I guess. That's difficult. That's really difficult so. I also would bring some gold blocks for the same reasons (as **AlexIIL**) and... IDK really what else. And maybe some diamonds too.

**Gdude**: Ok, **Kroppeb**.

**Kroppeb**: If I bring redstone components, can I make redstone in the real world?

**Gdude**: That's a good one.

**Kroppeb**: Whether I can buld gates or flying machines?

**OroArmor**: The original question said all other weird properties are fair game. So redstone would work.

**Kroppeb**: So I would make rail dupers or carpet dupers. I would bring a lot of activated rails, and then redstone would be very useful for the railway. So I guess maybe that. Then maybe Elytra, rockets, maybe some gold.

**CheaterCodes**: I think **Kroppeb** started on that. Gimme a stack of redstone blocks and a stack of pistons, and I'll solve the world's problem forever. Getting extra ??? just in case. Get some healing potions in there. You know they're going to sell more than just a bunch of dimaonds. Because if you bring a stack of diamond blocks they'll lose value. Think of the economy. If modded is ok, something that teleports.

**snoozestudios**: A beacon would be fun. I think you got to get some chorus fruit. You got to find out what it taste like. Maybe an elytra?

**Gdude**: I think I have to agree on the elytra. I guess not very accessible.

**CheaterCodes**: Ultimately, you would die from the first landing.

**Alizée**: I would probably take a respawn anchor and some glowstone. I mean, if they actually work, why not?

**Octal**: Alright, I think I would go with a shulker box completely full of clay because of how OP it is.

**OroArmor**: I think most of the people have said what most of the vanilla items are. So a bucket of axolotl, elytra, a bunch of fireworks. Not many people talked about modded, so I'm going to talk about that. So you could bring a bunch of emerald blocks, bring some villagers (in modded you can pick up villagers and stuff), then put them into the shulker box.

**Gdude**: All the remaining ones I have are trivial questions. ??? That's ok.

"What's your favorite Minecraft update?"

**AlexIIL**: I really liked the Caves update. I quite like caving in Minecraft. Having a lot of caves to go through is really cool.

**LambdAurora**: I'm not that sure. The reason is because Iike that there has to be one where I have that specific nostalgic feel, but I'm not really sure. If I had to go for nostalgic, it would be 1.4.7 because I started with it. But technically, it's 1.18 because I love the new worldgen and new blocks.

**Gdude**: Alright, that makes sense. **Kroppeb**?

**Kroppeb**: Sorry, I had something. That's a really hard question to answer. I don't really think I have a favorite one. Maybe the Redstone Update. (T/N: 1.5, Redstone Update.)

**Gdude**: That makes sense. **CheaterCodes**?

**CheaterCodes**: Easy, 1.13. From the modded perspective, I was just very glad when ??? broke off. And in general, I think the code since 1.13 has cleaned up a lot. It's just much more extendible and such. I only started in modded after 1.13. But having to use block data to add more wood blocks. From a player perspective, the ocean update which was visually my favorite update so far. It just made the ocean so much nicer and added different biomes. (T/N: 1.13, Update Aquatic.)

**MrMangoHands**: I guess it would be 1.16. I've been on Minecraft a long time, but wasn't that active for the whole time. 1.16 was the time I was playing a lot with friends, and the Nether update was good. And of course it was good for speedrunning.

**Gdude**: I don't have much connection to modern Minecraft. Even though I write a couple of mods. I would probably go with 1.13 because of the oceans. I would be a complete weirdo and talk about Minecraft Classic. The reason is because I spent so much time in it. I've been playing Minecraft since when it first existed, and I started a nice community there. And despite Mojang kind of killing it, there's still people playing it. So it's still viable.

**Alizée**: I would say 1.12 because that's when Mojang change the launcher. I ?????. I just really like those massive update that add something to the game.

**Octal**: I have two answer to that. Nostalgia reasons, 1.1 because that's when I started playing. Gameplay, 1.16 because of the updated Nether.

**OroArmor**: My favourite version definitely is 1.16. Like **MrMangoHands** said, I played a lot with my friends then. Maybe because of Covid, but that was definitely a fun version I played. Even though I never played it very much, as a technical player I really liked 1.13. Command system, ???. But all the changes were really interesting to me and I was always excited about what they'd do next.

**Gdude**: "What is your personal favorite mod?" And to avoid giving **AlexIIL** another heart attack, let's start from the top.

**OroArmor**: My personal favorite mod is my own mod. But beyond that... I was not expecting to go first - I would say Sodium. I really love what **JellySquid**'s done. It's really amazing and she's really pushing the limits of what graphic cards can do with Minecraft. For mods... I don't really have a favorite mod, but my favorite modpack was Project Ozone 3 (T/N: Actually [PO2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAVDbMgedXAoIzvMEoPyg7mW0T0gDZezo)), especially **EthosLab**'s series that really got me into it.

**Octal**: I guess my favourite mod is Aurora's Decorations because of the thought put into every single feature. For modpack, I guess Skyfactory 3 is one of my favourites.

**Alizée**: I think I would say Create. I really love automation games, and for me Create is the right middle ground between Minecraft and let's say Factorio.

**Gdude**: It's a very impressive mod I'd have to say. My long time favorite mod was actually Tabby Chat because of the quality-of-life features. Dark Chronicles has a mod called ??? chat which is like Tabby Chat on steroids. So if I had to pick a favorite now, it would have to be that.

(**Southpaw**: For the record, my favourite mod is the Carpet Mod, and the best console mod is the Lord of the Rings mod)

**MrMangoHands**: I think since 1.4. I'm not really up-to-date on content mods. **OroArmor** said Sodium is very cool.

**Gdude**: I have to agree with what everyone's saying about Sodium. It's one of the most mind-blowing mods I've ever used.

**CheaterCodes**: I have to say one of the mods is Botania. Create also, though I've never really played it. All the world crafting and avoiding inventory crafting. It's not really that new any more. But it's not just using a simple machine where you power it and item in, item out. It's a very creative approach to doing things.

**Kroppeb**: ??? amazing. But I haven't really played modded for a long time. But for me, maybe like an ME system from AE2.

**LambdAurora**: So one thing to note is that I'm pretty recent to modding. So there's a lot of mods that I don't know. But so far, for my favourites, are Create, ???, Sodium, Aurora's Decorations, and ???.

**Gdude**: Moving onto potentially the last question- Sorry, I forgot about you **AlexIIL**.

**AlexIIL**: I guess I don't have a favorite mod, never mind. It isn't technically mine, but I guess Buildcraft. I'm maintaining it. It was nice to see items flying around in the pipes.

**Gdude**: So the next question is the last question I have on my list. If anyone has questions they want to ask but haven't for any reason, I think the form is still there in the channel. We'll try our best to get through them, or **Alizée** will try her best to get them to us. 

"What is your favorite dessert?"

**OroArmor**: I was hoping you'd say that, because I actually have it with me. I'm going to put a [pic](https://discord.com/channels/817576132726620200/966049030104821821/966399953247301652) of it in chat. So I'll let it upload. I guess the picture doesn't come up very well but it's a lemon bar. But the reason it's my favorite dessert is because I love citrus, and lemon bars are absolutely amazing.

**Octal**: I don't really have a favourite dessert, so I'm going to say ice cream.

**Alizée**: I was looking at the question. Maybe some sort of chocolate cake. Anything chocolate-based is just awesome and everyone should try that.

**Gdude**: That makes a lot of sense. It's kind of a trick question for me, because recently I learned I was lactose intolerant. So I can't eat a lot of stuff now, but something I found was ~~comfeterols~~.

**MrMangoHands**: I'm not really sure but I can confirm that I do like desserts. 

**Gdude**: What if **MrMangoHands** liked mangoes?

**MrMangoHands**: Mangoes are good.

**CheaterCodes**: I've not a huge sweet tooth, but there are still plenty of desserts. So I'm going to say apple strudel.

**Kroppeb**: I can't choose, I'm like- If I had to choose, it would be biscuit pie. It would be the same as a sugar bomb, a massive cherry bomb. It's just some biscuits, sugar and butter mostly.

**LambdAurora**: For me, it would be- there's 2 of them. Firstly, chocolate cake. But not any one of them, just my mom's recipe. The other one, locally it's called drops. But if I tried to describe it, it would be chocolate chips in the shape of a ball.

**AlexIIL**: I always really liked cheesecakes to be honest. Though I can't say no to chocolate-based puddings. Any of them, if they've got chocolate in, then I'll  tend to like it.

**Gdude**: Yeah, I kind of miss cheesecakes. We've got a couple more questions in.

"Who do you or did you look up to in modding?"

**OroArmor**: I've only been modding since like 1.16, and I kind of came in not really knowing what I was going to do. and just started going. So I guess there's not really anyone I've been looking up to in that sense. I kind of came from the technical side, ???, but I guess **Masa** too.

**Gdude**: I don't really know who is or isn't a modder, so if you don't have anyone it's fine.

**Octal**: I guess the two people I look up to the most is **LambdAurora** and **Fusion Flux** because of how similar they are to me. I've been able to understand the stuff they talk about and it just makes me really happy.

**Gdude**: That is incredibly cute, thank you.

**Alizée**: I don't really do modding, but probably the developers of Quilt. It's just really impressive to develop a modloader like that. It's just mind-boggling for someone who hasn't just looked at their work.

**Gdude**: I'm also not a huge modder, I've written a couple of mods but I wouldn't say. I'll go the cliche route and say **asie**, and because I've known them such a long time and they've been involved in some interesting projects. Maybe **Eloraam** from Redpower because of how large that mod was.

**MrMangoHands**: Not really modding, but I've done RNG changing for spedrun tournaments, and I'll avoid the obvious joke. (T/N: Dream scandal)

**CheaterCodes**: I have not done a lot of modding in lke a while. I haven't really looked too deep in the modding community. For modpacks, I'm a huge fan of Sevtech by Darkosto, unless I'm completely remembering it wrong. Who has a really cool design in their modpacks. So to that extent I kind of need to make a modloader. Making mods that people enjoy, I find that inspiring. Hard to choose just a few ones.

(**asie**: "personally, i honestly have **Pahimar** to thank the most. fixing EE2's duplicate bugs in 1.1 Tekkit is how i got into modern-era Minecraft modding (edited)")

**Gdude**: Yeah, there's so many good people out there.

**LambdAurora**: I guess I would say DD. But for a long time I didn't know who **asie** was. But **asie** is definitely one of the others I look up to.

**AlexIIL**; I've always looked up to **SpaceToads**, not because he made BuildCraft. But because he always seemed approachable. Not like we really talked much, we didn't overlap time-wise. But that's why I'm here.

pgsnz: Everyone of the QSL team are fantastically smart people. **SuperCoder79**? Decompilers, that code base is one of the best codebases I've ever read. I'm not very good at modding actually, started in December. Also shoutout to **LambdAurora**. The entire team as well, the whole team in general is also super brilliant.

**Gdude**: "What did you work on right before you started working on Quilt?" **OroArmor**, how's your WiFi?

**OroArmor**: If the connection is established it works. If I try to make a new connection it doesn't work. Right before Quilt, let's see, trying to remember. So I think a month before rule #9, I think I had just got into the Yarn Triage Team. And so I was slowly transitioning from being a more- I only made one mod, Netherite Plus. I made some other mods but they had a couple hundred downloads each. So I ended up taking Netherite Plus and a lot of the stuff was very Mixin-heavy. Then I started geting involved in toolchain. So like de-hardcoding items so that you could have custom items, custom bows, stuff like that. Don't really remember what got me into it, something lke World Events that got me onto Pick and Yarn at the same time. And once Quilt happened  I was like, I want to join Quilt and that's what happneded

**Octal**: Before I joined Quilt, I was just thinking of learning how to mod stuff which is not really much. I started a couple projects before I joined the ??. Mainly I'm working with ??Boy from Geyser, making an addon to Geyser that people on Bedrock use to join modded servers.

**Alizée**: I'm personally new to the Minecraft community. Before that I was working on the Python Discord server. I had some fun there, but for some reason it stopped, so I decided to move and I found Quilt. And this is a fun time.

**Gdude**: I think at least 10 people know what I'm going to say, but it's what I was doing in the downtime between Fabric and Quilt at the time. So I got into Kotlin, and there wasn't really many Discord bots that used Kotlin, so I got started on KordEX. I can't really remember what else i was working on, but that's what I was spending most of my time before geting headhunted here.

**MrMangoHands**: I guess a lot of spedrunning. I wasn't a leaderboard mod until Quilt started. But I was there for like a month before Quilt came on. That was when most of the stuff was happening, a lot of world records. I actually stepped down somewhat recently, though I still own the Minecraft Speedrun Discord.

**CheaterCodes**: Well, I think I was just a little bit modding and then I got sidetracked to making a ?? API, got stuck and stopped doing it. I was mainly in Quilt and Fabric giving tech support. Every day I sat down in the train on the way to work and helped people with tech support. That's mostly for Quilt and with regards to modding.

**Kroppeb**: Making Minecraft datapacks, exploring Kotlin, and stuff.

**LambdAurora**: I would say... Good question... I wrote a mod, I was contributing to Fabric, especially the Resource Loader. Otherwise I was working on Aurora's Decorations and my mods. So yeah, not really much to say.

**AlexIIL**: I did a little bit of work for Fabric loader, but mostly it's just BuildCraft. That's about it. 

**Gdude**: **snoozestudios**?

**MrMangoHands**, **Gdude**: Snooze is snoozing.

**Gdude**: I don't think he can use his microphone at the moment. Yeah, go ahead and type that. Hehe, don't say the "Dream" word.

**snoozestudios**: "I was doing animation"

**Gdude**: That's totally fair, that's difficult stuff that. I believe that brings us to the end of the list. Is there anything that anyone wants to bring up here?

**CheaterCodes**: I want to give a big shoutout to **Glitch** for powering through last week. He did a great job and it's like a big part of the reason we're here now at this time.

**Gdude**: He has done a great job, I agree. Hopefully he feels better soon.

**CheaterCodes**: ??? I think he worked on Fabric API quite a bit, if I'm not mistaken.

**Gdude**: yeah, I mean it's been a ridiculous- I guess it's been a year since we went public with the server, and it's kind of insane to see the amount of effort that people put in. You guys don't see the development channels where people put in depth what they're going to work on. It's really helped to form the direction of the project since then. It's been really great to work with the development team, they've been really fantastic as well. And especially the community too.

**CheaterCodes**: Include yourself though, please.

**Gdude**: I can't blow my own horn too loudly, but thank you. Everyone who's worked on the community, or even if you've been here to show support, you're why we're here, and why we've reached here. Alright everyone, we're at the end of our list, and I'm emotionally burned out. Thanks for everyone for turning up. We have recorded this, though I'm not sure how this will turn out.

**CheaterCodes**: If anyone has any more questions they think of during the week, there is still our next developer meeting. Beta release would have calmed down a bit by then. It's on the Toolchain Server, `#toolchain-general`. You'll find a link on the Toolchain Server.

**CheaterCodes**: In dev meeting tradition, join us in `#voice`for the after party.

???: Thanks,

???: Bye.
