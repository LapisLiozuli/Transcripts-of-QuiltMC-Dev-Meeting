# Transcripts-of-QuiltMC-Dev-Meeting

Processed drafts transcribed using the online archived recordings on Spotify at https://open.spotify.com/show/0GIeDgw25tfWjb7dViiVfy

Also at https://anchor.fm/quiltmc-dev-meetings with summaries, but Google seems to have a hard time finding the link.

# Basic Ideas

As audio transcription softwares (both free and paid) are still struggling with multiple voices and accents, I opted instead to use shorthand to quickly jot down the points, and then convert it back to long-form with a script and a dict.

Contributors are welcome to amend or add to the transcripts, as in many areas I might lack technical expertise or exposure. Plus, due to time zones I'm usually unable to attend the meeting in real time so those who were there would likely have better clarity about what was being discussed back then.

Please note that I will have have to exercise my own judgment on how I merge PRs, especiallly if conflicts arise between them. Please be patient while I figure out exactly how best to standardise the format.

# Formatting

Names of people are **bolded** to help track the roster in each meeting, anybody who asked questions and anybody else mentioned during the discussions. This is mainly to distinguish them from the names of software or other words since online handles take a wide variety of forms. Apologies if I wasn't able to identify anyone by name, mixed up names or misheard names.

Any parts that are uncertain will have ~~strikethroughs~~ as an indicator. The uncertainty may be due to recording quality, lack of subject knowledge, etc. Apologies for any misheard words or mis-attributed quotes, and especially sorry for chunks that I wasn't able to parse. It's not meant to be personal, the developers are doing far more important work than these simple transcripts.

# To-Do

~~When all transcripts are finished, run a quality check on them for standardisation.~~

~~Add AnchorFM summaries to the top of each transcript.~~

Bold all names mentioned. Compile a list of names per transcript?

Decide on some way beyond Github to share the transcripts for public reference or additional correction.

~~Get the archive of #meeting-chat to better track any part of the meetings that occurred in text. Especially with regards to questions.~~
