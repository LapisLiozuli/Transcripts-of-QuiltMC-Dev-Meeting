# Transcripts-of-QuiltMC-Dev-Meeting
Processed drafts transcribed using the online archived recordings on Spotify at https://open.spotify.com/show/0GIeDgw25tfWjb7dViiVfy

Names are **bolded** to help track the roster in each meeting, anybody who asked questions and anybody else mentioned during the discussions.
Any parts that are uncertain will have ~~strikethroughs~~ as an indicator. The uncertainty may be due to recording quality, lack of subject knowledge, etc. Apologies for any misheard words or mis-attributed quotes, and especially sorry for chunks that I wasn't able to parse. It's not meant to be personal, the developers are doing far more important work than these simple transcripts.
