nngdu: Anw, how are you all finding the Beta? I was talk- to y'all in chat, how's the Beta folks. I thk I wasn't spk- close enuf into the mic last time. Yeah, I crtn[ figr_ tt wld hppn w the more cplx stuff. That's a Beta alrt. I hv seen some ppl work- over t, tho I hope they don't burn out. Ah, Discord once agn destroy- all my shortcuts.

Yeah, soonTM. Tho I wouldn't be supz_ if some of the others didn't want to hv a break aft a crunchy week. Honestly I've been a cplt traitor, I've been play- Create: Above and Beyond, so... Imn, I haven't played MC in years so this is great.

i saw effort being put into getting chasm functional under quilt loader already so that's something

nngdu: B4 we get start_, Mumble side, how's the audio?

Good

nncheat: Sounds great.

nngdu: Yeah, let's get start_ If you're new here, we do this every 2 weeks. It alw seems to last abt an hour, even up to the wire. If you have any qns, use the `/ask` cmd. nncheat, wld you lk to talk on behalf on ttbuto?

nncheat: X4tun[[, our main pgbuto guy, nngli, is not here atm. He's fix- stuff rn. But I wanna take this oppy to thank him. It's been supz-[ smooth, except for that one hotfix. Thr are some details, I actl[ 4got to pin it. ??? pull- in fapi hb one of hte biggest issues. Whcih cb disabled with depends substitution. I wld strongly rcmd not to use this bcz it can mess stuff up. I have this swhr in the common Discord, but I nd to find it. If you hv any issues, feel free to ping nncheat, that's me. But so far it's been fairly smooth, luckily.

nngdu: I blv you're also down for CHASM, so kp gg if you lk.

nncheat: CHASM wasn't actl[ a part of Beta, so thr wasn't actl[ a spritn to mk it hppn. I was try- to make sth ??? over the past few days, it j integ_ nicely into Loom, which was  a supz. Now I'm try- to get it load_ into Qload, which is take- a bit longer j bcz I've nvr loaded Qload b4. And I've been fix- a few bugs here adn thr, nth big. But now Beta is over, I'm look- fwd to gett- back into CHASM. I wld lk to pt out tt rn I'm bsc[ solo- CHASM, so I wld rly apc8 aone help-. The worst part is out of the way, but thr's still a ton of work.

nngdu: It's gg tb an amazing tool, and it'll be rly useful for the entr Java ecosys and not just Quilt. Ty nncheat. We'll mv onto Comy Tools, and tt's me. W Beta... On Discord you'll notice tt Cozy h replaced our old tag sys. It's on Github.. so if aone wants to steal tt, go ahead. It's on the Maven.

Rgrd- teh wlcm chnl, We're not q rdy to use tt yet. It's kinda a data-driven wlcm chnl.

As for the website, I j rlz_ it doesn't work tt well. But it works.

If aone is a CurseForge user, plz go gv us a vote at the link I put in chat. It helps out a lot.

https://curseforge-ideas.overwolf.com/ideas/CF-I-2662

I'm work- on lk a guide for newcomers, thr's still a lot of stuff to go for tt.

nnax, wld you lk to talk for qload?

nnax: Well, nngli has done a lot of inrl fixes, which is gd. But the public chgs is tt the Quilt pre-launch entrypoint name has to chg, bcz it turns out we cannot use the same one as Fabric's. quilt_launch

We got a few mixin compat fetr which is impt for Fabric mods. Thr's a few other fixes but I won't talk abt them here, but you c see the chg log for those.

nngdu: It's nice to see so many Fabric mods work- out of the box, even so recently into Beta

nnax: I thk you c thank Quilted FAPI for tt.

nngdu: Anw thx for tt nnax. nnoro, it's your turn for Mapg I blv.

nnoro: Ig thr's not too much for mapg. We're chugg- along with those. I wld lk to say tt the Rendering Mapg PR was merged soemtime in the past week, I don't rmb xk[ when it was merged. So the rendering mapg for Quilt shld be accu and up to date. And we're work- hard on try- to get eth mapped rn, esp as Mojang kp add- more and more stuff, but it's gg along well.

nngdu: ty nnoro. Next up is nnaurora w the ttqsl.

nnaurora: Not a lot of ths hv hppn_ since Beta. So since the last mtg, the Recipe API got merged, the Scraper API, and QSL also got published for Beta. But we published the Quilted FAPI model. And since Beta, we had 10 betas for Quilted FAPI and 6 betas for QSL. I'm not a big fan fo entries being merged, lk ??? API, which cld be compared to a registry dict or sth lk tt. O/w thr's not much to say. Bring- Quilted FAPI to Beta was a lot of work, and q stressful, and I don't even know if I'm supposed to talk abt Quilted FAPI rn. But for qsl, aside for ask- for more ctrb], lk rvw- PRs, I don't hv much more to say.

nngdu: Alrt, ty for tt. Ah yes, did they resp? They did not resp dangit, I'll hv to mispronounce it. We have a new team, Quilted fapi team w nnem and Ennui. But we have kidnapped nnscr to speak for them.

nnscr: So qfapi is now a th by nnem and Ennui spfc[. It used tb called fapi=qsl, but it was reorganised and is now called qfapi. It allows new fetrs to be added quicker. But in order to prvt issues w Fabric mods tt dpd on the api not hv- the same vrsn. But it uses a special api to treat it as if usrm the mod was thr. So you don;t hv to iinstall mtpl ths if you don't want to go tt route. And nnem hb helpful rcnt[ to prvd the qfapi to target 0.15.1, which as far as we know is the latest public rls.

nngdu: Ty for tt. Alrighty, tt brings us to the end of the list. I've alr asked how most of you are doing w the Beta. It seems tb mostly positive. But as w any Beta proj, it seems tt ppl hb work- over t to fix bugs, which is great. nnoro?

nnoro: A lot. I know thr was a v big rush, and I wanna thank eone on the team for mk- it to the ddln. Thr was a lto of issues, and we xpk_ a lot of issue. But what supz_ me is tt eone managed to fix most of the prbms, and taken tt energy and cont_ to mv it fwd. Bet 6 for qsl, Beta 9 for qfapi, We're constantly mk- chgs, but at the rate we're gg, I thk a 1.19 rls is fsbl. But qsl needs to mature a bit more, but w the energy we hv rn, we c do a lot.

nngdu: I agree w tt. It's amzg how much teh velocity oft he proj h picked up over the last mth and so. It's j great to see how all this hard work is pay- off yk. Ty nnoro. Tt's the end of the planned segment, and it's the segment whr eone comes to ruin our day.

nncheat: In the mntm, how was Beta on the ttcomy?

nngdu: Bz. I shld pull out the stats, but it's been crazy. It hasn't been too much stress for us, but I'm j gonna tk a sccreenshot of the stats here and you'll see what Imn. Look- at the joins for the past mth, you c see tt we rly peaked when we annc_ Beta. And now we're at 300 joins this mth bcz of the Beta.

It's the highest join rate since the start of the server)

Since we're test- all the applications thru Discord, we're rly putt- it thru the paces now. But it's been great. Even the msg rate is much higher than xpk_ Lk in March we had 19K msg. Then last week we had 30K to 40K. But I'm happy, it's all gd news.

nncheat: Yeah, for the server, I rly apc8 how chill it is. Not much bad stuff hppn- so it's rly cool.

nngdu: Imn, a lot of our users are also rly fanta ppl. One of the ths we wanted to do is encourage comy mmbrs to help out w moderation bcz we can't be ewhr at the same time. It's been not so good in a few of my prev comys, but Quilt has been fanta. So pls kp send- us modmails.



nncheat: I'll tk this qn.

XanderStuff#4796 (171375148006506496)

any ideas on how could quilt overcome the fears of new contributors? "Unfortunately" quilt has some very talented individuals working on the various team, so I feel like it might make joining a team be perceived as "you have to be similar in abilities to the current team members". idk, maybe that's just me?

Firstly, I'll ask ppl: Do aone know me? I'm not rly well=known in the modded comy. Thr are a few v talented ppl on the team, and a few dfcl tasks lk my baby CHASM. But the rest is j normal coding. But if you cpbl of Java prog-, you're cpbl of ctrb-. And if you're not, mapg ctrb] doesn't nd Java knlg. And if you feel tt you're gett- the hang of it, you c join and do more. Sure thr's stuff tt's hard, but we j nd help. Not necs[ the smartest ppl, but we j nd help. Thr's enuf stuff to do in Quilt.

nngdu: Yeah, the th w Quilt is tt we have so much work tt we nd aone who's OK w Java. I thk we cld do a bit btr w Github lk having better issues set up. But if you wanna help out, j let us know. Tell us what you're gd at and we'll find a place for you. Thx for tt, nncheat. I thk I c ans a couple of these.

Zaeroses ðŸŒ·#6355 (806065199609937980)

how has the reception of quilt been in the community so far (before and after the beta)? we aren't part of the community outside of the toolchain server, so we don't really have any picture of the popularity or opinions of mod devs or players

Tt's a rly itrs- qn honestly. Being a proj born fr what we're born fr, thr are a few ppl not willing to csdr us and tt's fine. Rcnt[ thr was a rather controversial post on the /r/ftb. Thr are ppl wonder- why we're splitt- the comy, or not gett- into old drama. I'm actl[ writing a post on this to clear up ths. It's hard to get into the dtls bcz it's such a big comy. But I hv been promised tt a lot of ppl hvb supt- us. I was supz to see tt ATLauncher quietly add supt for us. PolyMC too, Modrinth.

I don't thk tt opinions hv chg_ too much from pre=Beta to Beta. Some ppl came in and said, yes, it's up, I'm gonna use this now. Thr's been some negative reception but I thk it's the outliers. It's been great to see.

I'll tk this one qk[ and one of you shld tk teh ETA one.

nncheat: Tt'll be mine as well, but aft you.

Where can I donate?

We were actl[ hold- off of this on a while until rls. As most of you might know, all of the infra costs are being borne by nnhav. Open Collective to share the costs, and show transparency. Take the stress off of nnhav's wallet, esp csdr- the time and stress he's put into this.

nncheat: Chris? "Chris is my name," thr you go.

Any ETA on VanillaGradle or Chasm being publicly available for mods to use in development?

No, not rly. Pgvg, I've not rly been kp- tabs on tt. I haven't heard much of it on the Sponge Discord whr it's dev_. But thr are Github updates. What's missing is ???? Rgrd- CHASM, I'm work- on gett- it into qload. I'm not sure when it'll be avbl. It'll mb be a branch of qload. But the more I look at it, the more it seems tt I'll hv to remove Mixins and access wideners. So dfnt[ a few months more.

nngdu: Alrt, thx for tt nncheat. These rly seem tb largely comy qns for a chg. I'm not rly sure how to ans tt tho.

nncheat: We don't rly hv an ans to tt, but let's tk it up and try it out.

is there any way that you can/are making sure that people are not overworking themselves while working on the project?

So one th is tt we hv a pretty chill comy on the Tlcn Discord, so we don't ask ppl to over=work tslv. But if you hv a way to mk sure tt ppl don't over=work tslv.

nngdu: I've been look- into tt, but as a serial over=worker mslf, I am worried abt tt. Lk nngli is kinda burned out w the amt of work rcnt[. But if aone has any ideas on tt, we'll tk them on.

What contingency plans, if any, do you have in situations where Discord goes offline due to technical difficulties/outages?

We were on Matrix for a while, but it turned out tb impossible to moderate j from a tknl perspective. I looked into Zuellig, but it was a bit weird and it gave eone's email addrs to staff mmbrs and I wasn't too happy abt tt. Thr's Revolt, a Discord=clone, and I've set up an unofficial server thr. But it's not rdy. Thr's Github Discussions, eone's thr. We're also work- on gett- the forums up soon, the **Starchild** sys is work- on tt. Thr's stuff lk ??? and Slack, god forbid.

Does the Community Team have a team on GitHub, for the use of the relatively new-ish organization moderators feature?

I've look\_ at it, but it doesn't q help us. The only way to delete issues is to ?? admin, so we're look- at add- fn to Cozy rather than gv full access to eone to the entire team. Github Perms suck. The moderations help, but we still do hv tb able to del issues, and it's still not q thr x4tun[.

Why is the icon for the Toolchain Server webhook in the community server different from the Toolchain server's avatar? :)

It's j Discord round- the corners too much. IDK why it's lk tt, it shld be xk[ the same. They're xk[ the same icon.

does quilt have a more general goal as far as the player experience as a whole goes? like, a general goal linking together how players would interact with various areas of quilt in practice?

nnoro: I thk I c. We prvd fetrs to allow players to play w mods in their own dffr[ ways. If tt makes sense, I can't thk of tt other than as a devr, but Ik tt loader plugins bring new user exp.

nngdu: The error popup, and installation process. A lot of ths Quilt has is iteration on older ths. We're not tt gd, but impv- on older ths.

What is qsl idk im new to devloping?

nnaurora: So bsc[ qsl is Quilt Std Libs. They are tools for devrs to ixrt w the game more ezy. Or to work tgt w other mods. Foreg, none of the APIs prvd ways for mods to = My thot prcs got interrupted = they can prvd ways for mods to... lk create blocks, in ways whr it won't conflict w other mods and stuff.

I heard before that Quilt is meant to support multiple games besides Minecraft. Any hint on what kind of other games? (@Lapis Liozuli)

nnax: This is sth v spfc to qload, whr you c customise it to work w other games. I don't thk the ttload is doing this spfc[. We're still abstract- a lot of stuff. But the main hint abt what kind of games is Java=based games.

Jaai#9049 (730700346069876776)

Would be adding a standard like must download package for devloping stuff? (like Aurora just stated)

nngdu: I c guess what this means. Tt's bsc[ what the pgbuto are. IDK what else to say abt tt. The way you dev mods for Quilt, and ideally you folw the setup in the example mod. It's hard to ans a qn lk tt, but tt's how you write Quilt mods.

Tt brings us to the btm of the list of qns. We do hv a few more mins if we hv ath tt ppl wanna discuss. Tt goes for ppl on Mumble as well.

nncheat: A qk ty to the comy for test- stuff, for will- tb our beta testers for stuff tt broke. It's rly helpful.

when quilt will stop support fabric how will the migration work?

Thr  isn't a tmln for it, but we'll j mntn it until it bcms too much to mntn. If thr comes a pt whr mntn- Fabric supt is detrimental to the rest of the Quitl proj, then we'll stop doing tt. We'll hand it over to the comy to handle. We'll prvd supt o/c, but we'll hv to plan for tt outcome eventually. Tt will also be on the newcomers' guide I'm writing, and the FAQ as well, bcz I did not word those v well last t I wrote them.

nncheat: I thk we're gd.

nngdu: I thk I'll pt out a comment in chat:

ideas on lessening burnout: 
quilt devops team, and/or people dedicated to checking-in on quilt team members, making sure they're not being burned out, and asking questions to sus out anything that could be an indicator of burnout or dissatisfaction with interacting with other team members.

note: actually this could maybe be a nice thing for more than just dev team, could be for mod and admin team as well.

kinda reminds me of one of the roles of the ship's councilor in startrek

A secretarial team cld be useful, so the devrs cld focus on dev-. It cld be useful, but it's hard to say whether it cld be useful rn.

nncheat: I thk it originates on the burnout th. The th is, it wld be a v unthankful job and you nd the right person for tt. You can't j throw a volunteer at that. Burnout proper is a medical condition, and you need a professional for help. You don't want to throw ppl at ppl who are burnt out, and they wld be at risk at burnout tslv. Thr is an altv of doing peer stuff, lk hv ppl ard you notice when they talk to you.

nngdu: Imn, all of us are avbl to help out. I thk the best way to help out is to have more ppl on the teams. Having more developers, having more moderators, all cld use a few more pairs of hands. Having more ppl to share the load is prob the best way to prvt burnout, as nncheat says.

Looks lk tt's the end of it. As nncheat says, it's great tt ppl are help- us test the Beta. So pls kp it up, and we'll see you in two weeks.
