nngdu: Anw, how are you all finding the Beta? I was talk- to y'all in chat, how's the Beta folks. I thk I wasn't spk- close enuf into the mic last time. Yeah, I crtn[ figr_ tt wld hppn w the more cplx stuff. That's a Beta alrt. I hv seen some ppl work- over t, tho I hope they don't burn out. Ah, Discord once agn destroy- all my shortcuts.

Yeah, soonTM. Tho I wouldn't be supz_ if some of the others didn't want to hv a break aft a crunchy week. Honestly I've been a cplt traitor, I've been play- Create: Above and Beyond, so... Imn, I haven't played MC in years so this is great.

i saw effort being put into getting chasm functional under quilt loader already so that's something

nngdu: B4 we get start_, Mumble side, how's the audio?

Good

nncheat: Sounds great.

nngdu: Yeah, let's get start_ If you're new here, we do this every 2 weeks. It alw seems to last abt an hour, even up to the wire. If you have any qns, use the `/ask` cmd. nncheat, wld you lk to talk on behalf on ttbuto?

nncheat: X4tun[[, our main pgbuto guy, nngli, is not here atm. He's fix- stuff rn. But I wanna take this oppy to thank him. It's been supz-[ smooth, except for that one hotfix. Thr are some details, I actl[ 4got to pin it. ??? pull- in fapi hb one of hte biggest issues. Whcih cb disabled with depends substitution. I wld strongly rcmd not to use this bcz it can mess stuff up. I have this swhr in the common Discord, but I nd to find it. If you hv any issues, feel free to ping nncheat, that's me. But so far it's been fairly smooth, luckily.

nngdu: I blv you're also down for CHASM, so kp gg if you lk.

nncheat: CHASM wasn't actl[ a part of Beta, so thr wasn't actl[ a spritn to mk it hppn. I was try- to make sth ??? over the past few days, it j integ_ nicely into Loom, which was  a supz. Now I'm try- to get it load_ into Qload, which is take- a bit longer j bcz I've nvr loaded Qload b4. And I've been fix- a few bugs here adn thr, nth big. But now Beta is over, I'm look- fwd to gett- back into CHASM. I wld lk to pt out tt rn I'm bsc[ solo- CHASM, so I wld rly apc8 aone help-. The worst part is out of the way, but thr's still a ton of work.

nngdu: It's gg tb an amazing tool, and it'll be rly useful for the entr Java ecosys and not just Quilt. Ty nncheat. We'll mv onto Comy Tools, and tt's me. W Beta... On Discord you'll notice tt Cozy h replaced our old tag sys. It's on Github.. so if aone wants to steal tt, go ahead. It's on the Maven.

Rgrd- teh wlcm chnl, We're not q rdy to use tt yet. It's kinda a data-driven wlcm chnl.

As for the website, I j rlz_ it doesn't work tt well. But it works.

If aone is a CurseForge user, plz go gv us a vote at the link I put in chat. It helps out a lot.

https://curseforge-ideas.overwolf.com/ideas/CF-I-2662

I'm work- on lk a guide for newcomers, thr's still a lot of stuff to go for tt.

nnax, wld you lk to talk for qload?

nnax: Well, nngli has done a lot of inrl fixes, which is gd. But the public chgs is tt the Quilt pre-launch entrypoint name has to chg, bcz it turns out we cannot use the same one as Fabric's. quilt_launch

We got a few mixin compat fetr which is impt for Fabric mods. Thr's a few other fixes but I won't talk abt them here, but you c see the chg log for those.

nngdu: It's nice to see so many Fabric mods work- out of the box, even so recently into Beta

nnax: I thk you c thank Quilted FAPI for tt.

nngdu: Anw thx for tt nnax. nnoro, it's your turn for Mapg I blv.

nnoro: Ig thr's not too much for mapg. We're chugg- along with those. I wld lk to say tt the Rendering Mapg PR was merged soemtime in the past week, I don't rmb xk[ when it was merged. So the rendering mapg for Quilt shld be accu and up to date. And we're work- hard on try- to get eth mapped rn, esp as Mojang kp add- more and more stuff, but it's gg along well.

nngdu: ty nnoro. Next up is nnaurora w the ttqsl.

nnaurora: Not a lot of ths hv hppn_ since Beta. So since the last mtg, the Recipe API got merged, the Scraper API, and QSL also got published for Beta. But we published the Quilted FAPI model. And since Beta, we had 10 betas for Quilted FAPI and 6 betas for QSL. I'm not a big fan fo entries being merged, lk ??? API, which cld be compared to a registry dict or sth lk tt. O/w thr's not much to say. Bring- Quilted FAPI to Beta was a lot of work, and q stressful, and I don't even know if I'm supposed to talk abt Quilted FAPI rn. But for qsl, aside for ask- for more ctrb], lk rvw- PRs, I don't hv much more to say.

nngdu: Alrt, ty for tt. Ah yes, did they resp? They did not resp dangit, I'll hv to mispronounce it. We have a new team, Quilted fapi team w nnem and Ennui. But we have kidnapped nnscr to speak for them.

nnscr: So qfapi is now a th by nnem and Ennui spfc[. It used tb called fapi=qsl, but it was reorganised and is now called qfapi. It allows new fetrs to be added quicker. But in order to prvt issues w Fabric mods tt dpd on the api not hv- the same vrsn. But it uses a special api to treat it as if usrm the mod was thr. So you don;t hv to iinstall mtpl ths if you don't want to go tt route. And nnem hb helpful rcnt[ to prvd the qfapi to target 0.15.1, which as far as we know is the latest public rls.

nngdu: Ty for tt. Alrighty, tt brings us to the end of the list. I've alr asked how most of you are doing w the Beta. It seems tb mostly positive. But as w any Beta proj, it seems tt ppl hb work- over t to fix bugs, which is great. nnoro?

nnoro: A lot. I know thr was a v big rush, and I wanna thank eone on the team for mk- it to the ddln. Thr was a lto of issues, and we xpk_ a lot of issue. But what supz_ me is tt eone managed to fix most of the prbms, and taken tt energy and cont_ to mv it fwd. Bet 6 for qsl, Beta 9 for qfapi, We're constantly mk- chgs, but at the rate we're gg, I thk a 1.19 rls is fsbl. But qsl needs to mature a bit more, but w the energy we hv rn, we c do a lot.

nngdu: I agree w tt. It's amzg how much teh velocity oft he proj h picked up over the last mth and so. It's j great to see how all this hard work is pay- off yk. Ty nnoro. Tt's the end of the planned segment, and it's the segment whr eone comes to ruin our day.

nncheat: In the mntm, how was Beta on the ttcomy?

nngdu: Bz. I shld pull out the stats, but it's been crazy. It hasn't been too much stress for us, but I'm j gonna tk a sccreenshot of the stats here and you'll see what Imn. Look- at the joins for the past mth, you c see tt we rly peaked when we annc_ Beta. And now we're at 300 joins this mth bcz of the Beta.

It's the highest join rate since the start of the server)

Since we're test- all the applications thru Discord, we're rly putt- it thru the paces now. But it's been great. Even the msg rate is much higher than xpk_ Lk in March we had 19K msg. Then last week we had 30K to 40K. But I'm happy, it's all gd news.

nncheat: Yeah, for the server, I rly apc8 how chill it is. Not much bad stuff hppn- so it's rly cool.

nngdu: Imn, a lot of our users are also rly fanta ppl. One of the ths we wanted to do is encourage comy mmbrs to help out w moderation bcz we can't be ewhr at the same time. It's been not so good in a few of my prev comys, but Quilt has been fanta. So pls kp send- us modmails.

nncheat: I'll tk this qn.

XanderStuff#4796 (171375148006506496)

any ideas on how could quilt overcome the fears of new contributors? "Unfortunately" quilt has some very talented individuals working on the various team, so I feel like it might make joining a team be perceived as "you have to be similar in abilities to the current team members". idk, maybe that's just me?

Firstly, I'll ask ppl: Do aone know me? I'm not rly well=known in the modded comy. Thr are a few v talented ppl on the team, and a few dfcl tasks lk my baby CHASM. But the rest is j normal coding. But if you cpbl of Java prog-, you're cpbl of ctrb-. And if you're not, mapg ctrb] doesn't nd Java knlg. And if you feel tt you're gett- the hang of it, you c join and do more. Sure thr's stuff tt's hard, but we j nd help. Not necs[ the smartest ppl, but we j nd help. Thr's enuf stuff to do in Quilt.

nngdu: Yeah, the th w Quilt is tt we have so much work tt we nd aone who's OK w Java. I thk we cld do a bit btr w Github lk having better issues set up. But if you wanna help out, j let us know. Tell us what you're gd at and we'll find a place for you. Thx for tt, nncheat. I thk I c ans a couple of these.

Zaeroses ðŸŒ·#6355 (806065199609937980)

how has the reception of quilt been in the community so far (before and after the beta)? we aren't part of the community outside of the toolchain server, so we don't really have any picture of the popularity or opinions of mod devs or players

Tt's a rly itrs- qn honestly. Being a proj born fr what we're born fr, thr are a few ppl not willing to csdr us and tt's fine. Rcnt[ thr was a rather controversial post on the /r/ftb. Thr are ppl wonder- why we're splitt- the comy, or not gett- into old drama. I'm actl[ writing a post on this to clear up ths. It's hard to get into the dtls bcz it's such a big comy. But I hv been promised tt a lot of ppl hvb supt- us. I was supz to see tt ATLauncher quietly add supt for us. PolyMC too, Modrinth.





I don't thk the opinions hv chg_ too much betw pre=Beta and current. I will say thr hvb ppl tt were lk, "I'm not sure if this is gonna rlsÂ ," and then came in and said, "Yes! there's a Beta now, I'm gonna use this now." It's been great to see too o/c. But yeah, overall it's been pretty gd. Crtn[ thr's been some negative reception but overall I thk tt's the outliers. It's been great to see. Here's the link. Tt's not the link I want. Ty Browser.

I'll tk this one qk[ and one of you shld tk teh ETA one.

nncheat: Dfnt[ mine as well, but aft you.

Where can I donate?

We were kinda hold- back on this for a while now bcz we hadn't rls_ a rls. As some of you might know, most of if not all of the Quilt infra is actl[ paid out of nnhav's pocket. To try and rls some of tt stress, we actl[ set up an Open Collective which I'll link in chat. We're use- this not j for donations, but also show tt we cb tpnt w our fncs. Bcz we don't wanna get into a sitn whr lk we're get- donations and no one knows whr's the money gg or ath lk tt. So if you rly want to donate, you c. It's cplt[ optional, o/c, we'll kp truck- along. But it'll be great to take some of the stress off of nnhav's wallet, esp csdr- how much time and money he's put into this. 

But yeah, thx for tt qn. nncheat, wld you lk to tk one?

nncheat: Yep, abs[. You may pronounce his name, bcz I cannot.

nngdu: I j call him Chris. That's not his real name but... 

nncheat: Let's j call him Chris. "Chris is my name," well, thr you go. The qn is:

sschr15#4563 (300606625297727489)

Any ETA on VanillaGradle or Chasm being publicly available for mods to use in development?

Well, no clearly. Pgvg, I've not paid too much to rcnt dev]s. Thr hasn't been too much hppn- on the Sponge Discord which is whr I usually look for upd8s. But commits are hppn- e now and then. So I cannot ans too much about pgvg. I thk what it's mostly miss- is re=mapping jars at the end, bcz I thk input mapping is fine. But yes, tt's miss-. 

Rgrd- CHASM, as said b4, I'm work- on get- into qload. I'm not sure how soon it'll be avbl. It's gonna be either j a branch of qload whr I make some unoffiical builds so ppl c test it out. But the more I look at it now, the more lkly it is tt I'll actl[ hv to cplt[ rmv remove Mixin and access wideners to add CHASM. Which means for test-, it's gonna be a while until Mixin and CHASM are back. So dfnt[ not gonna hppn on the main Loader any time soon. It's gonna be dfnt[ a few months more.

nngdu: Alrt, thx for tt nncheat. These rly seem tb largely comy=themed qns for a chg. Lenrik asked a qn, I'm not rly sure how to ans tt tho.

nncheat: We don't rly hv an ans to tt, at least not rn.

nngdu: We kinda don't, but I wld lk to hv one.

nncheat: Well, let's tk the qn and talk abt it. So lenrik asked:

lenrik#5193 (437296242817761292)

is there any way that you can/are making sure that people are not overworking themselves while working on the project?

So I thk one ez way is tt we hv a  pretty chill comy on the Tlcn Discord, so thr's usually not too much pressure fr other ppl to get sth done qk. But if you are thk- of ath in ptcr, any options you hv to mk sure tt ppl don't over=work tslv, plz let us know. It's not sth we've rly looked into, I thk.

nngdu: Yeah, Imn I wld q lk to see some ideas on tt, bcz it does bother me. As a serial over=worker mslf, Ik tt ppl c get into tt sitn. And lk we metn_ earlier, nngli is kinda burned out bcz of the amt of work tt nd_ tb done to rch the Beta trgt. We hv tb thk- abt tt a bit more care[[ if we do tt agn w anor ddln. But yeah, it wld be great to hear some ideas. If aone has any ideas on tt, we'll tk them onboard to listen to them.

sciwhiz12#1286 (607058472709652501)

What contingency plans, if any, do you have in situations where Discord goes offline due to technical difficulties/outages?

Or I asum a roving band of mutants.

Well, we hv a few ideas. We did look into alt chat ptfms a lil while ago. We actl[ were on Matrix for a while, but tt turned out tb bsc[ impossible to moderate prpr[. J from a tknl perspective, it j wasn't up to scratch and we weren't gg to host one j for 3 chnls. I looked into Zewdlip: While it worked q well, it was a lil weird and it also gave eone's email addrs to staff mmbrs and I was not happy abt tt. Anor th is Revolt, which I csis[[ 4get to chk on. But Revolt is a Discord clone I've been kp- an eye out on. Thr is a server thr unofficially tt I've set up for Quilt, but it's not rdy for use. It's j not, it'll get thr, but it's not thr yet. 

Anor altv I metn = even if Discord does go a bit dark = we do have Github Discussions. Eone's thr, more or less, so we are able to fn still. And we are also plan- on get- a forum up soon, hope[[ anw. Ik the **Starchild** sys is work- on tt. So those are the ths we're look- at atm. 

I rly wanted Matrix to work. It doesn't. I wish it did bcz it wld be lk the ez option for us, but yeah, it's j not gonna do it. Thr's other options o/c, stuff lk Githere? and MatterMost? and Slack, god forbid. But we'll see. Idth it's gonna be a realistic issue. Lk we hv the website, so if sth does hppn, we c qk[ set up sth if we nd to. I'm not super worried rn, tb super honest. Oh, that's some news I c ins.

## kb1000 *â€”* Today at 12:39 AM

Tt's gd news. Ig we'll be get- Quilt supt in tt shortly. But kp an eye on the website for tt one, I'll upd8 the page when we hv more info on it. Anor qn from sciwhiz:

sciwhiz12#1286 (607058472709652501)

Does the Community Team have a team on GitHub, for the use of the relatively new-ish organization moderators feature?

Not spfc[ for tt prps. I've look\_ at it, but it doesn't rly help us x4tun[[. The main issue is, it kinda halfway bridges the gap, but we nd tb able to del issues. And the only way to do tt is w RecoAdmin? atm. So our curr apch is gonna be add- fn to Cozy tt c do tt on our behalf rather than gv all the ttcomy full access to eth. The ttinfra h a Cozy a/c on Github tt I setup, so tt's prob what we're gonna use for tt. It wld be nice if Github Perms didn't suck. Rly annoyingly, on Github Enterprise, you c set them up xk[ how you want them. So idk why you can't j do tt on Github. But yeah, it's not an ideal setup. The moderation thing helps, but we do nd tb able to del issues, so yeah, it's still not q thr x4tun[.

Sciwhiz w the comy qns. These are alm all comy qns. Imn I'm fine w tt, but it's j unusual.

nncheat: Bcz the comy's so amzg.

nngdu: Yeah, you're right. They are, they are amzg.

sciwhiz12#1286 (607058472709652501)

Why is the icon for the Toolchain Server webhook in the community server different from the Toolchain server's avatar? :) 

It's j Discord round- the corners too much. It shld be xk[ the same, IDK why it looks lk tt. It is the same icon.

sciwhiz12#1286 (607058472709652501)

does quilt have a more general goal as far as the player experience as a whole goes? like, a general goal linking together how players would interact with various areas of quilt in practice?

nnoro: Oh yeah, you nd to click it, hehe. Idth necs[ irxt w the dffr[ areas of Quilt, but we wanna prvd a more unified way for ppl to j play. So, one of the main ths w tt, our Loader plugins, so tt you c load Fabric mods. Whr the player exp isn't so much formed ard us irxt- w pull=up?, but we prvd fetrs to players tt allow them to play w mods in their own dffr[ ways. If tt makes sense, I can't thk of tt others since I'm more of a devr, but Ik tt Loader plugins will be sth unq tt Quilt brings to the player exp.

nngdu: Imn, I thk it's a gd qn. A few ths tt come to mind for me are UX ths, lk fix- the terrible erorr popup, and get- a nicer installer and all tt. Imn, a lot of the ths tt Quilt is do- is sort iterating on older ths tt were nvr tt gd, but rly cld do w attn and impv ths. At least fr what I've seen. It's itrs- tt **Zaeroses** bcz **Zaeroses** is work- on error stuff atm, or at least plan- to, as far as I know. It's kinda a dfcl qn to ans w the way it's phrased, but tt's what comes to mind for me. 

Alrt, nnaurora, go ahd and take tt one. It's OK, click the other one, nbdy will notice, hehe.

Jaai#9049 (730700346069876776)

What is qsl idk im new to devloping?

nnaurora: So bsc[ qsl is the Quilt Std Libs. They are tools for devrs to irxt w the games more ezy. Or unified ways to try to bridge to other mods. Foreg, one of the APIs prvds ways for mods to= My thot prcs got interrupted, so what was I say-? So they can prvd ways for mods to... lk create blocks, but in ways whr it won't conflict w other mods and stuff.

I heard before that Quilt is meant to support multiple games besides Minecraft. Any hint on what kind of other games? (@Lapis Liozuli)

nnax: This is sth v spfc to qload. Tt it's meant tb able to customise Qload in a way tt you cld use it for other Java=based games. But I don't thk the QuiltMC Team is directly doing this in add]. We're still abstract- a lot of Qload stuff away from MC spfc[ to mk this psbl. So it's not lk sth tt we prvd. But the main hint abt what kind of games is other Java=based games.

Jaai#9049 (730700346069876776)

Would be adding a standard like must download package for devloping stuff? (like Aurora just stated)

nngdu: I hv a qn w some typos in. I thk c guess what this means. Tt's bsc[ what the pgbuto are. IDK what else to say abt tt. The way you dev mods for Quilt, and ideally you folw the setup in our example mod, using the eg mod w our pgbuto. It's kinda hard to ans a qn phrased lk tt, but tt's how you write Quilt mods.

Tt brings us to the btm of the list of qns. We do still hv a few mins if anyone h any further qns, or if thr's ath tt ppl wanna discuss. Tt goes for ppl on Mumble as well o/c.

nncheat: I wanna say a qk ty to the comy for actl[ helping in the Beta test and help- to gv fdbk on stuff tt's broken.

when quilt will stop support fabric how will the migration work?

We're not plan- on drop- supt in the sense tt lk thr's a tmln for it. We're j gonna mntn it until it bcms too much for us to mntn, Ig. If it gets to the pt whr mntn- Fabric supt is detrimental to the rest of the Quilt proj, then what we'll do is, we'll stop mntn- it, and we'll hand it over to the comy to mntn on their own. Obv[ it won't be etir[ on their own. We'll supt them thru it, but it's not j sth we wanna see disappear, even if it gets hard to mntn. It's j tt we'll hv to plan for tt eventuality more than ath. Tt will also be on the newcomers' guide tt I'm writing btw, and I'll update the FAQ as well. Bcz I did not word those v well the last t I wrote them. Thx for tt qn sciwhiz, I must decline your offer to show Kotlin, hehehehe.

nncheat: I thk we're gd.

nngdu: Yeah, tt seems lk eth. I'll j ment a comment made in chat. Zoe points out xey thk tt it wld be itrs- to hv a team for mng- ths to do w the other teams. So XanderPoes? correctly point- out tt the teams mng tslv more or less. But I cld see a secretarial team being more or less useful, j to handle the busywork of proj mng], so tt the devrs can dev. Hwvr, I'm not sure we nd it rn. It wld be itrs-, and it cld be q useful, but it's hard to say in the moment whether it'll be a good idea.

ideas on lessening burnout: 
quilt devops team, and/or people dedicated to checking-in on quilt team members, making sure they're not being burned out, and asking questions to sus out anything that could be an indicator of burnout or dissatisfaction with interacting with other team members.

note: actually this could maybe be a nice thing for more than just dev team, could be for mod and admin team as well.

kinda reminds me of one of the roles of the ship's councilor in startrek



nncheat: It seems to originates from the etir burnout th. So I thk tt's dffr[ fr what you're thk-.

nngdu: You thk so? Oh, I see.

nncheat: I thk it was mostly abt hv- someone to lk mk sure tt ppl aren't burnt out. The th is, tt wld be a v, v unthankful job and you j nd the correct person for tt. Tt's not j sth whr you could j throw any volunteer in. Deal- w burnout is lk... If it's proper burnout, it's a medical condition, esnc[[. It's a mental health issue, not j someone nds a lil bit of help. It's not sth I wld j wanna throw aone in.

nngdu: Yeah, xk[.

nncheat: And ppl who lk then hv to deal with burnout ppl are v vulnerable to burnout tslv as well. So you need a professional for tt, and we don't hv a professional for tt. 

nngdu: Tt's also true. It's an itrs- idea, but tt is a lot of gd points you mk thr, hehe.

nncheat: Imn, thr is an altv of j doing peer stuff. J be sure to talk to ppl ard you so they can notice it and they c help clear on. J spread the load among the etir team and then it's fine. But, yeah. Yeah!

nngdu: Yeah, Imn I will say, it's not lk we're not here for each other. As nncheat said, thr is a pretty chill comy on Tlcn and inrl[ in gnrl. Lk, nbdy's left on their own to deal with ths, but it j sometimes it gets to the point whr thr's not lk enuf ppl on sth. It wld be gd, and I thk prob the easiest way to mitigate tt is w more ppl to help out w the dffr[ projs. Lk pretty much all of the projs cld do w a few extra pairs of hands. The ttcomy cld do w a few extra pairs of hands, a couple extra moderators. Pretty much eone cld do w a few more helpers. Tt's probably the easiest way to avd ppl burn- out: It's to spread the load as nncheat says.

Alrighty, yeah, it's been abt an hour, so I thk we're gonna call it here. Thx for coming eone. As is trad, I'm sure they'll be a sorta after=party in the `#voice-chat` channels. Mb thr won't, but who knows? And yeah, we'll see you agn in 2 weeks, o/c. And thx for coming. And as nncheat says, it's been great tt eone's been will- to help w the Beta. Plz kp using it, and kp throw- issues at us. It's gd to get ths fixed, and we can't test eth on our own, so thx. We'll see you in two weeks.
