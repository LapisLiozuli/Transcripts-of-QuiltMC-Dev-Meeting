nngdu: So, this is gonna be a smwt dffr[ mtg. We'll wait a j a lil bit for more ppl to show up, but they shld get some pings. Hey Ara. So, the 4mt of this mtg hasn't chg_. However, you won't see the spkrs on Discord. They'll be talk- via the Cozy Mumble bot tt we hv set up, tt is curr[ not set as a spkr so we can'thear them rn. In a couple mins we will chg tt, and we'll see who shows up. 

Also j tb clear, you c type in the #meeting=chat chnl, right? Yep, OK, gd. Hey Livia, hey Merchrome. Wlcm wlcm. For the sake of not mk- this look so empty, I stay| in the stage, but I'm gonna be mute- and deafen- mslf and talk- via Mumble. Thr mb a small bit of latency but I don't imgn it'll be too bad. This is the first t we've done this. We did test it, but yk how it goes. I'm gonna set tt up right abt now. Alrt, tt appr tb work-. We'll j gv it a couple more mins. But yeah, hey eone from the other side of breach. Hey Trollzer, hey Pinkosick. Yeah, it's weird isn't it? Don't worry, it usually takes people a few mins.

nnoro: Mb we shld mk a mtg role, and then ping tt for attenders of this mtg.

nngdu: If you RSVP=_ to it, you wld hv gotten a ping when I started the event. We will tell you who we are, don't worry kb1000. You will not be lost, hope[[.

I'm lost.

I'm muted.

I'm disappointed in the number of groans I got abt tt. We usually do it for abt an hr, Parzi. I haven't seen it run over q a long t, so we shld be fine. Altho we'll see. Hey Kropp.

Kropp: Nbdy's talk-?

nngdu: We haven't started. We're abt to tho. Since you're here, do you hv ath abt CHASM?

Kropp: No.

nngdu: Tt's alrt. Well, we m as well get started then. Hello eone. Hope[[ you know my dumbass voice by now. It's nngdu. This is the first mtg we've had since Xmas, since b4 Xmas even. Obv[ it's tkn some t for ppl to get back in the swing of ths, tt's fine. I thk we've metn_ this b4, but we tend to skip over teams tt don't hv too much to say. We'll be doing tt today, thr's a couple teams tt thr's not rly much to talk abt, and thr's a couple teams whr ppl j aren't here atm. "Try agn in two weeks." But we shld be good.

So we hv nbdy here from ttbuto, and CHASM hasn't been too bz, so ig we're starting with ttcotl, which is bsc[ my team. ttcotl is mostly Cozy rn. Thr hb some work. A lot of what I've been doing hb infra =level kinda stuff, so istd of drct[ work- on fetrs, I've been 1o[ rewriting parts of Cozy. Tt's hppn- 1o[ to break up the code a bit into modules, which has the advtg of allow- other ppl to mk use of fetrs of Cozy in their own bots if they want to. Asum- they're using the same fetrs as us, which thr's a lot of bots using tt ard here , so I figured why not.

nngli hb doing work on the Github integ] stuff. It's slow work bcz thr's no API wrapper tt does eth. It turns out tt Github's APIs are q xcsis[. Thr are ths you c only do via Rest in the Github API and ths you c only do via GraphQL. So nngli is having to combine both of those tgt. It's a pain. It is a pain. But it's get- thr.

Obv[ thr is a lot of Cozy stuff to do. I am work- on modules atm, but I thk I will prob be tk- a break fr tt soon. Esp bcz Discord h gvn us a few more toys to play with, moderation=wise, tt nd tb set up. Can't rly gv you much info on tt rn, but we'll get there. I thk tt's all abt it for ttcotl atm. It looks like ttinfra is next. nnhav, wld you lk to intro yslf?
