nngdu: 5 mins of so, mk sure tt more participants are able to join. But b4 all tt it's t to get craiged. We're now being craiged. 

Quet'd? (T/N: Quilt + Beta) I said craiged. I'll xpln tt in a min. Craig and Giarg?

Are you in here, nnkrop? Are you able to join teh stage on your own, or do I nd to pull you up? OK, how abt now? Nice, hi nnkrop. B4 we get started, I'd like to ask all particpatns toe joni teh stage. You all nd tb up here bcz of how we've got this setup. I'll try to drag ppl up but I might miss some.

How many do we have? 14?

Beta buzz guys. It's alm t to get started. Alrighty. Well, wlcm to the stage eone. I asum= we don't hvv a full set of participatns but I asum they'll be in and out. I asum eone c hear my cough OK.

Alrighty. So we're j gonna start off gg who's on stage atm and what we do. I know a couple of yuou don't hv mics and tt's fine. I know most ppl know who I am as comy mngr. Octal is part of our team, doing events. Alizee is another one of our moderatosr working hard to put this togt. nncheat do you wanna go over waht you do?

nncheat: I'm a devr work- main ly onf  CHASM and pgbuto. I've been work- oin mpag stuff too.

nnkrop: I'm nnkrop I help out with CHASM adn decopmiler.

nnax: I'm nnax I work on loader mostly.

nnaurora: Hi I'm nnauroar, I'm a devr and mianly a QSL core mntnr and also part of the ttmap. 

nngdu: TYVM. You're a lil bit quiet ther, I asum it's j mic dist tho. Right then, let's get start_ shal we? We hv a set of qns picked up fro our Googel form. It's been poste in our #annc] chat for a few days. I'm gg t o pic ka few qns, and then pic kon eof you to ans it. The other, we'll do a sort of round-table format.

What does Quit entering beta actl[ mean?

nncheat: Tt's a big qn rly. In short, qbeta was a target for devrs to get stuff gg so tt the comy c do sth w Quit and we can get fdbk. So we set a ddln to make it public so tt we can't j kp push- it off. For most of the comy it means tt you c use quilt to lk code mods. So use qmap on qsl on qqload. So qmap hb out now for how long?

nngdu: A few mths, rly. So what wld you say are the next ths tb work_ on during beta? At least on your end.

nncheat: Ig if you don't speak to aperson spfc[, I'll j speak agn. For me, it's mostly CHASM. I want to get CHASM work-. In a modd- env it means get it runn- on qload, runn- on Loom. Mixins is a bigger proj.

nngdu: I've crtn[ seen a few projs ppl worked on post=Beta. The installer is a big one. Not a big one but dfnt[ needs doing. Zoe is work- on the erorrs, or making the rrors look nicer. Not sure of the other teams, but doesn't aone else need ath tt needs look- at aft the tart of beta?

nnax: For qload, it's to make sure tt it's runn- and can handle most sitns fairly well, rather than having work tt nds tb done on it.

nncheat: mapg, we rly want it to get work- on the fully auto=upd8- as well. The upd8- of mapg is being done e week w/o much human input, so we're hope- to chg tt rly soon.

nngdu: Alrt, let's move onto a round-table format.

"What was the hardest mooment in quilt's dev] for you?"

nncheat: The hardest moment? E t I work on Gradle, ig. Ig tt's the correct ans. If they wanna talk abt sth that is rel_ to pdtn, then IDK. CHASM hb fairly smooth other than some rly hard thk- at the start. But once tt was done it was rly ez so far.

nngdu: Tt's gd. Certn[ seems there was a lot les friction than we xpk_ w it. nnkrop, your turn.

nnkrop: IDK rly. ????

nncheat: J say more abt the CHASM th. Say more abt the terinology while talk-= baout it for 3 hrs. J use dfr[ words.

nngdu: Ig. nnax?

nnax: The most dfcl part was kp- it usrm to kp it cmpt w Fabric. nngli did most of tt, but the work still h tb done.

nngdu: nnaurora? No, do we hv mic death? Yep. She'll be back in a min. Wlcm back.

nnaurora: It was mostly Quilted fapi. Bcz for a long while I was the only one mntn- it and it was q dfcl. O/w it was and it still is mapp- as a prcs. Bcz port- the mapg to a new vrsn is still kinda dfcl bcz we're use- kinda sketch tools as well. But IDK rly wahat else.

nngdu: Tt's alrt. OK, the nxt qn I hv is another round-table.

"What is or was your fvr[ part fo Quilt to work on?"

nncheat: My fvr[ part? I'd thk Gradle, but it's both true and wrong. It's rly annoy- to work w, but I lk the chlg. IDK, so it's a love=hate rlsp. CHASM was actl[ q fun, onc you got past the complicated stuff. Thr were a lot of chlg, but most of them w rly smooth ???. CHASM=Lang also, in gnrl.

nnax: Prob Quiltflower, bcz it's lk a huge codebase nad e time you go into it, you find new stuff to discover. It's kinda lk a cplx puzzle tt nds fix- in places.

nnaurora: MY fvr[ parrt, I wld say, I hv not a lot of fvr[ parts. I would say first is when we switched to using Mumble for mtgs. My other fvr[ parts is when ?? bcm usable and when Recipe API got merged.

"Why rls Quitl on Apr 20th?"

nngdu: It's a Beta rls rather than a stable rls, let's mk tt clear. But coincidentally the day we opened this to the publci was 4/20 last year. So I figr_ it was a good date to ope nthe beta after a year. But a lot of ppl

nncheat: Tbf, one of the rsns I voted fo rthe date was bcz it was ez to rmb. Some ppl wnate to push it back to sAt or Sun, but 4/20 is so ez to rmb e year. If you awnt anniv, it's ez to rmb. Funny number is ez to rmb, so tt's good.

"How or why did you get ivlv_ w Quilt in the first place?"

nngdu: I actl[ didn't hear abt Quitl until aft a couple of mths aft the proj started. This kinda surprises a lotta ppl bcz I kind ended up being the face of it. But the rsn I bczm the comy mngr is bcz ppl asked me to do it, and tt's why.

Octal/Tubbo, you said you wanted to ans this one?

I thk Discord is j fight- w our mics today. Tt's alrt, we'll cont on until you figr out your mic issues.

Alizee: C you hear me? Mostly it was just nngdu talk- about this th called Quilt over and over agn in comy servers, so I thot, what is quilt. It seemed lk an itrs- proj so I got ivlv.

nncheat: I don't rly know, tbh. I wasn't thr at teh v start. But I heard abt it I thk= mb lk day 2 or 3 of the discord server aft gg public. After tt I tried look- at teh tlcn and sniff- ard.

nngdu: this is my proj.

nncheat: well nnearth started on this proj and I kinda picked it up.

nngdu: As alw

Octal: I was= the rsn I got intro_, i got started w Quilt stuff was tt I was rlvt[ new to modd- at the t. And I had heard abt quilt and the ppl bhd it, and i thot, yeah, I agree w tt. And when the quilt discord server bcm public, it bcm one of my fvr[ comy, and I applied to bcm a comy mngr.

Even though I'm not on the stage, I want to answer this:
I got an invite to quilt in gdude's now dead Fabric Community server and a few months down the line decided to apply for moderation ![:pineapple~1:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/834191878416105502.webp?size=44&quality=lossless)

nnkrop: I thk my story is mostly the same as Octal?

nnaurora: So for me I hv a hist w Fabric. Bcz I was ivlv_ in Woven, which kinda was lk Quilt but also diffr[. It was not success[ but it led to some itrs- stuff. I thk ivlv- stuff and some dislike of Fabric tt started to settle in mslf. Then suddenly in Mar of last year, I get a msg from nnsup inviting me to the famous Quilt Initiative Discord server, which was ???, and tt's how I got ivlv_.

nngdu: Ty. I see snooze has dcd_ to drop in.

snooze: I thk I j saw in various dffr[ modd- comy, and I thot it look_ itrs-. The n Ithot it look itrs- and dcd_ to join. Not as itrs- as the rest of you.

nnax: I'd been look- to impv Buildcraft. First I went to Fabric, but thr wer a few controversies tt I won't go into. Then I moved to Quilt, mostly bcz a few ppl I worked with moved to Quilt. Though I was thr from the bgn-.

nngdu: Thr's a few qns next. "Official Quilt eg mod when?"

Hope[[ today. I'ts one of the ths I've been wait- on b4 makin an annc]. Oh, I've been pinged. It's been done apar[. Nbdy told me tt. Thr's a link in the  chat.

"Is thr Quilt-Fabric link?"

I was hoping nngli wld be here. Patchwork will be a thing. Loader plugins would mk load- Fabric a lot more feasible on Quilt. Sth is coming, not fr us, but it's coming. nncheat, mb you wanna ans this for variety.

"Why don't we kp bwd compat w Fabric?"

nncheat: Ig I haven't been talk- enuf yet. Tt's cute. The ans to tt is, we do. In gnrl, we don't hv a ddln of we must supt Quilt istd of a Fabric vrsn for one year or sth. We j don't want to hv to supt Fabric, only as long as it bnft us. Hope[ Quilt will bcm the bigger modloader, and then thr'll be no rsn to supt a modloader tt's smaller. Evidently tt's not true now, but when it iswe'll drop Fabric.

Ig this is for nnaurora. "Why do we nd QSL as an extra mod even tho we also nd qload?"

nnaurora: Oh no, I j got confused b ythe qn. The rsn is simple. The modloader is much= made to work across a lot of dffr[ MC vrsns at once. While QSL is made for only one. It'll upd8 w e vrsn of MC. Thr'll alw be sth tt breaks it. So mk- it ??? is much btr bcz it reqr much less of the qload and stuff. O/w= For now it's an extra mod, and it's smlr to how Fabric has fapi and the Fabric loader split. Foreg Forge too tries to work twd a split lk tt. Bcz it's j much more ezr to mng. And also kinda ezr for eone to mntn.

"When do you plan to work on docs and when willl they replace the Fabric one?"

Docs are kinda split into two parts. First is for devrs. We do hv docs for QSL, they's not on Maven but they'll get thr soon. As for sth lk Fabric wiki, nnoro hb work- on sth lk tt. He'll be thr in about 30 seconds. J got confirmation, heh'll be over to tell us more abt tt. As for user docu, I wld hope to expand those to a proper wiki as well, but we still hv work to do on those.

nnoro: Yes, so for devr wiki, a lot of ppl hv expresss_ their issues w how the Fabric wiki is 4mat_, how the code is outdated, written for 1.15 but now it's 1.18. So fro the devr wiki the ocde h tb able to compile. Since the code is actl, real code tt is used to xpln what's gg on. Byd tt I hvaven't done too much prototyping. Bsc[ it's one massive Gradle proj tt turned into a webpage based on what I've done so far. It shld be btr than Fabric wiki, and btr than Forge wiki so tt we hv the best wiki of all the modloader.

nngdu: Lofty goals but I'm sure you c get thr. I thk this one is for you too. [My qn]

What do you think o fthis nnoro? Ig it's ask- what we hv over them.

nnoro: Quilt is swhr betw Forge and Fabric. Forge is v strict, API is practially forced. They've started moving away from tt w Loader. Bnft of strong central API w Forge but a lot of the flex] tt Fabric prvds. Some of the other devrs you can try to say sth.

nngdu: I wld say CHASM wld be a big part fo Quilt's VP when it comes ard.

nncheat: I hope so. It's a bit awkward bcz j say- CHASM, to most ppl it's j confusing .But bsc[ the goal is to allow the comy to mk sth lk Mixin Extras w/o= Mixin Extras allow to make sth cplt[ new w/o reqr ??? in Loader. You don't hv to wait for us to prvd loader injection, you c j do it yslf. Which I thk is rly impt for LT maintain].

Alrt, nxt qn then. "If you had to gv one rsn why to choose Quilt over another modloader?" Tt sounds lk an admin qn to me, nnoro.

nnoro: So, fr a player perspective, theory[ thr shld be v lil chg. It shld feel lk Fabric, to the pt whr you c tk your favr[ Fabric pack and mod up. We're not q thr yet, bcz some modders use itrs- ways to get their mods work-. You also, as a player, shld hope[ be able to ustd the issues btr, esp surrd- modloading. Some ppl hv express_ concerns over Fabric's= If you';re missing a mod, tt loading screen cb confusing for new players. So hope[ Quilt's screen is a lot more dcrb[ and ezr to ustd.

For devrs, we hope to hv a larger API than Fabric. So take Fapi and expand and impv on tt. So a lot fo hte module sin qsl are practically 1=to=1 w Fabric and hv extra stuff on top of them. Then, qmap are a lot clearer. Fabric has a cleanroom policy, so ????, makes it a lot harder to gert help for cross=platform work. Qmap got rid of the cleanroom policy, ???.

A lot of the constants in the game are a lot harder to figr out, but w Mojmpa we c now see what tt is

nncheat: I thk the qn was a bit mis=ustd. I thk it was abt one th.

nnoro: The #1 th for a player=

nncheat: I thk the ans for a player shld be fairly ez: Btr mods. Bcz we are mostly devr=focused ,adn from the Quilt devr side, most fo the Quilt devrs are mod devrs, so obv[ trgt- a lot of ths btr for mod devrs. So ath tt makes ths btr for mod devrs mk it evtl[ btr for players.

nngdu: I'v ebeen sus tagged in. "Will it come to MultiMC?" It.

Peterix said tt he'll csdr merging it when it bcm a bit more popr. I thk it's still psbl to get Quilt work- if you're on the special instance. If you're on the tlcn server, I thk thr's a special instance pinned, but you hv to get the JSON set up which is kinda a pain. 

If you're look- for an altv, you c use PolyMC but I know tt some ppl are unhappy w tt. We're aim- for launcher cvrg so hope[ we'll see.

This is an itrs- one, but I'll excuse mslf. "If you cld bring a shulker box of items from MC into the real world fr survival, what wld you bring?"

nnax: Oh, tt's a dfcl qn. Ig 27 stacks of Gold blocks is an ez one. Or mb gold ingots, they wld be ezr to sell. 

nngdu: Modded item?

nnax: Too many possibilities. A lot of fun iin the real world, but also dnagerous. Ender portals wld be a bit dnager[, gg to hell and all. I don't think MC is suited the real world.

nngdu: I thk most ans wld be some vary] of gold or diamond.

snoose: elytra nd fireworkss seem fun. Enchanting table too. Put a pencil inide and get Unbreaking 5 on it. Oh, it nd to break though.

nncheat: If you wear pants, you shld put mending on it or sth.

nnaurora: 27 items is q  a lot. One th I wld bring is a trident. I think I wld bring a bucket of axolotl. And a shulker box of shulker shells, to mk more shulker boxes. The qn is whether I can craft stuff w what I bring or not. 

nngdu: But I blv tt was the case, tho it's not mentioned.

nnaurora: I wld bring wood blocks, shulker shells to craft more shulker boxes. Then if my IRL inv was as bad as MC inv= 

nncheat: It says no crafting allowed.

Oh, then a bundle, Ig. Tt's dfcl. Tt's rly dfcl so. I also wld bring some gold blocks for the same rsns (as nnax) and... IDK rly what else. And maybe some dimaonds too.

nngdu: Ok, nnkrop.

nnkrop: If I bring RS components, c I make RS in the real world?

nngdu: Tt's a gd one.

nnkrop: Whether I can buld gators or flying machines?

nnoro: The og[ qn said all other weird ppty are fair game. So RS wolud work.

nnkrop: So I wld mk rail dupers or carpet dupers. I wld bring a lot of activated rials, and then RS wld be v useful for the railway. So ig mb tt. Then mb elytra, rocket, mb some gold.

nncheat: I think nnkrop started on tht. Gimme a stack of RS blocks and a stack of pistons, and I'll solve the world's prbm forever. Get- extra ??? j in case. Get some healing potions in thr. Yk they're gonna sell more than j a bunch of dimaonds. Bcz if you bring a stack of diam blocks they'll lose value. Thk of the econ. If modded is ok, sth tt teleports.

nn: A becaon would be fun. I thk you gotta get some chorus fruit. You gotta find out what it taste lk. Mb an elytra?

nngdu: I thk I hv to agree on the elytra. Ig not very access[

nncheat: Ulti[, you wld die from the first landing.

Alizee: I wld prob tk a respawn anchor and some glowstone. Imn, if they actl[ work, why not?

Octal: Alrt, I thk I wld go w a shulker box cplt[ full of clay bcz of how OP it is.

nnoro: I thk most of the ppl hv said what most of hte vanilla items are. So a bucket of axolotl, elytra, a bunhc of fireworks. Not many ppl talked abt modded, so I'm gg to talk abt tt. So you cld bring a bunch of emerald blocks, bring some villagers (in modded yo ucan pick up villagers and stuff), then put them into the shulker box.

nngdu: All the rmn- ones I hv are trivial qns. ??? That's ok.

"What's your fvr[ MC update?"

nnax: I rly liked the Cave update. I q lk caving in MC. Having a lot of caves to go thru is rly cool.

nnaurora: I'm not tt sure. The rsn is bcz Ik tt thr hv to be one whr I hv tt spfc nostalgic feel, but I'm not rly sure. If I had to go for nostalgic, it wld be 1.4.7 bcz I started w it. But tknl[, it's 1.18 bcz I love the new worldge nand new blocsk.

nngdu: Alrt, tt makes sense. nnkrop?

nnkrop: Sorry, I had sth. Tt's a rly hard qn to ans. I don't rly thk I hv a fvr[ one. Mb the RS update.

nngdu: Tt makes sense. nncheat?

nncheat: Ez, 1.13. Fr the modded perspective, I was j v glad when ??? broke off. And in gnrl, I thk the code since 1.13 has cleaned up a lot. It's j much more xtd[ and such. I only started in modded after 1.13. But hv- to use block data to add more wood blocsk.

Fro ma player perspective, the ocean pdate which was visually my fvr[ update so far. It j made the ocean so much nicer and dfffr[ biomes.

Mango: ig it wld be 1.16. I've been on MC a long time, but wasn't tt active for the whole time. 1.16 was the t I was play- a lot w friends, and the Nether update was good. And o/c it was gd for speeduning.

nngdu: I don't hv much onnceiton to modern MC. Even tho I write a couple of mods. I wld prob go w 1.13 bcz the oceans . I wld be a cplt weird o and talk abt MC classic. The resn is bcz I spent so much t in it. I've been play- MC since when it first existed, and I started a nice comy thr.. And despite Mojang kinda kill- it, thr's still ppl play- it. So it's still viable.

Alizee: I wld say 1.12 bcz tt's when Mojang  chnge the launcher. I?????. I j rly lk those massive upd8 tt add sth to the game.

Octal: I hv two ans to tt. Nostalgia rsn, 1.1 bcz tt's when I started playing. Gameply, 1.16 bcz of the updated nether.

nnoro: My fvr vrsn dfnt[ is 1.16. Lk Mango said, I played a lot w my friends then. Mb bcz of Covid, but tt was dfnt[ a fun vrsn I played. Even tho I nvr playted it v much, as a tknl player I rly lk_ 1.13. Cmd sys. But all the chgs were rly itrs- to me and I was alw excited ab twhat they'd do next.

nngdu: "What is your personal fvr[ mod?" And to avd giving nnax anor heart attack, let's start fr the top.

nnoro: My perosnsl fvr[ mod is my own mod. But byd tt... I was not xpk- to go first = I wld say Sodium. I rly love what Jelly's done. It's rly amazing and she's rly push- the limits of what graphic cards can do w MC. For mods... I don't rly hv a fvr[ mod, but my fvr[ modpack was PO3 (PO2), esp Etho's sereis tt rly got me into it.

Octal: Ig my favr[ mod is Aurora's Deco bcz of hte thot put into every single fetr. For modpack, Ig Skyfactory 3 is one of my fvr[.

Alizee: I thk I wld say Create. I rly love auotmation game, and for me Create is the right middle ground betw MC and let's say Factorio.

nngdu: It' a v impressive mod I'd hav eto say. My long time fvr[ mod was actl[ Tabby chat bcz of hte qol fetr. Dark chronicles has a mod claled ??? chat which is like Tabby chat on steroids. So if  Ihad to pick a fvrp now it wld hv tb tt.

(nnsouth: For the record, my favourite mod is the Carpet Mod, and the best console mod is the Lord of the Rings mod)

Mango: I thk since 1.4. I'm not rly up to tdate on content mods. nnoro said Sodium is v cool.

nngdu: I hv to agree w what eone's say- abt Sodium It's one of the most mind-blowing mods I've ever used.

nncheat: I hv to say one of the mods is Botania. Create also, tho I've never realy played it. All the world crafting and avoid- inv crafting. It's not rly tt new any more. But it's not j using a simple machine whr you power it and item in, item out. It's a v creative approach to doing things.

nnkrop: ??? amazing. But I haven' t rly played modded for a long time. Btu for me, mb lk an ME system from AE2.

nnaurora: So one th to note is tt I'm pretty recent to modding. So thr's a lot of mods tt IDK. But so far, for my fvr, are Create, ???, Sodium, Aurora's deco, and ???.

nngdu: Moving onto potl[ the last qn= Sory, I forgot abt you.

nnax: Ig I don't hav e afvr[ mod, nvm. It doesn't tknl[ mine, but Ig buildcraft. I'm mntn- it. It was nice to see items fly- ard in the pipes.

nngdu: So the next qn is the last qn I hv on my list. If aone has qns they want to ask but haven't for any rsn, I thk the form is still thr in the chnl. We'll try our best to get thru them, or Alizee will try her best to get them to us. "What is your fvr[ dessert?"

nnoro: I was hoping you'd say tt, bcz I actl[ hv it w me. I'm gg to put a pic of it in hcat. So I'll let it upload. Ig the pic doesn't come up v well but it's a lemon bar. But the rsn it's my fvr[ dessert is bcz I love citrus, and lmeon bars are abs[ amazing.

octal: I don't rly hva fvr[ dessert, so I"m gg to say ic cream.

Alizee: I was look- at the qn. Mb some sorta choc cake. Ath choc=based is j awesome and eone shld try tt.

nngdu: Tt makes a lot of sense. It's kind a trick qn for me, bcz recent[ I learned I was lactose intolerant. So I can't eat a lot fo stuff now, but sth I found was comfeterols.?

mango: I'm not rly sure but I c confirm tt I do like desserts. 

nngdu: What if mango liked mangoes?

mango: Mangoes are good.

nncheat: I've not a huge sweet totoh, but thr are still plenty of desserts. So I'm gg to say apple strudle.

nnkrop: I can't choose, I'm lk= If i had to choose, ti wld be biscuit pie. It wld be the same as a sugar bomb, a massive cherry bomb. It's j some biscuits, sugar and butter mostly.

nnaurora: For me, it wld be= thr's 2 of them. Firstly, choc cake. But not any one of them, j my mom's recipe. The other one, locally it's called drops. But if I tried to dcrb it, it wld be choc chips inthe shpae of a ball.

nnax: I alw rly liked cheesecakes tbh. Tho I can't say no to choc=based puddings. Any of them, if they've got choc in, thne I'll  tend to like it.

nngdu: Yeah, I kinda miss cheesceks. We've got a couple more qns in.

"Who do you or did you look up to in modding?"

nnoro: I've only been modding since lk 1.16, and I kinda came in not rly know- what I was gg to do. and j started gg. So Ig thr's not rly aone I've been look- up to in tt sense. i kinda came from the technical side, but Ig Masa too.

I don't rly know who is or isn't amodder, so if you don't hv it's fine.

octal: Ig the two ppl I look up to the most is aurora nad fusion bcz of how smlr they are to me. I've been able to ustd the stuff they talk about and it j makes me rly happy.

nngdu: Tt is incredibly cute, ty.

alizee: I don't rly do modding, but prob the devrs of Quilt. It's j rly impressive to dev a modloader lk tt. It's j mind-bolgging for sone who hasn't j looked at their work.

nngdu: I'm als onot a huge modder, I've written a bcuopl eof mods but I wouldn't say. Cliche route and say asie, and bcz I've known them suc ha long time and they've bene invovled in some itrs- porject.s Maybe eloraam from Redpower bcz of how large tt mosd was.

mango: Not really modding, RNG changing for speedrun tournmaenets, avd the bov joke.

nncheat: I hv not done a lot of modding in lke a while. I haven't rly looked too deep inteh modding comy. For modpacks, I'm  a huge fan of Sevtech by Darkosto, unless I'm cplt[ rmb- it wrong. Who has a rly cool dsin in their modpack.s So to tt xtt I kinda ned to make a modloader.

   any additional question y'all would like to ask?

Making mods tt ppl enjoy, I find tt inspiring. Hadr to choose j a few ones.

Yeah, thr's so many good ppl ou thr.

nnaurora: Ig I wld say DD. But fo ra long t I didn't know who asie was. But asie is dfnt[[ one of the others I look up to.

nnax; I've alw look_ up t oSpace toad, not bcz he made BC. But bcz he alw seemed approacheable .Not lk we rly talked muhc, we didn't overlap time wise. But tt's why I'm here

snooze: Eone of hte qsl team are fanta smart ppl. nnsup? Decompilers, tt code base is one fo the best codebases I've ever read. I'm not v good at modding actl[, started in Dec. Also shoutout to nnaurora. The entire team as well, the whole tema in gnrl is also super brilliant.

nngdu: "What did you work on right before you started work- on Quilt?" nnoro, how's your wifi?

nnoro: if the connection is etbh_ it works, if I try to make a new connection it doesn't work. Right before quilt, let's see, trying to rmb. So I thk a month before rule #9, I thk I had j got ont hte Yarn triage team. And so I was slowly transitioning from being a more= I only made one mod, Netherite Plus. I made some other mods but they had a couple hundred DLs each. So I ended up taking Nteherite Plus and a lot of the stuff was v Mixin-heavy. Then I started get- ivlv_ in tlcn. So lk de=hardocing items so tt you could have cust items, cust bows, stuff lk tt. Don't rlyrmb what got me into it, sth lke World Events tt got me onto Pick adn Yarn at the sme tim.e And once Quilt hppn_  I was lk, I wanna join Quilt and tt's what happned_

Octal: B4 I joined Qilt, I was j thk- of lrn- how to mod stuff whic h is not rly much. I started a cuple projs b4 I joined the ??. Mainly I'm work- w ??Boy from Geyser, making a na addon to Geyser tt ppl on Bedrock use to join moddee servers.

Alizee: I'm personally new to the MC ocmy. B4 tt I was swork- on the Python discord server. I had some fun thr, but for some rsn it stopped, so I dcd_ to move and aI found Quilt. And this si fun time.

nngdu: I thk at least 10 ppl know what I"m gg to say, but it's what I was doing int hte downtime betw Fabric and Quilt at the time. So I got into kotlin, and thr wasn't rly many discrod bots tt used kortlin, so I got started on kordex. I can't rly rmb what else i was working on, but tt's what I was spend- most of my time befoore get- headhunted here.

mango: Ig a lot fo speedrunning. I wasn't a leaderboard mod until Quilt started. But I was thr for lk a month b4 Quilt came on .That ws when moost f othe stuff was hppn- a lot of world records. 

I actually stepped down somewhat recently, though I still own the minecraft speedrun discord

nncheat: Well, I thk I was j a lili bit modd- and the n Igot sidetrackede to making a ?? API, gort stuck and stoped doing it. I was ainly in Quilt and Fabric gv- tech supt. E day I sat in the trian and help- ppl with tech supt. Tt's mostly for quilt and w regards to modding.
