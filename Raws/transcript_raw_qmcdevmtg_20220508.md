nngdu: Now it's tt t whr I ping eone. Hello eone, wlcm to yet anor Devr Mtg.

nnem: Yay~

nngdu: Yay. I'm excited, why aren't you excited, hehe. Usually we wait a few mins j to allow ppl to show up, so we'll be start- in abt 5 mins. As you m hv xpk_, or mb haven't xpk_, we do hv some gd news today. But I m 4get to tell it, so yk, tough luck if tt hppns, hehe.

nncheat: Are we j supposed to bcm a spkr the etir t? J for when we talk, or...?

nngdu: The easiest th to do, bcz bcm- a spkr is lk mtpl button clicks, I would rcmd bcm- a speaker and then muting yslf until you're talk-.

nncheat: I thk it's j one, but sure.

nngdu: Is it? Oh yeah, thr's a th at the botm, isn't thr? Wtvr, it doesn't matter too much. As long as y'all are here. RFC 54? Which one is tt? Is tt the Kotlin one? Yeah, I hv to admit, I haven't had a single moment to look at that yet.

nnem: But other ppl can!

nngdu: Yeah, abs[. I hear it's a pretty bz one. It's gd tb doing this on Discord agn. I know tt not eone's a fan of it, but it does mk our lives q a bit ezr. We're also test- a new Craig, so tt'll be itrs-. I'm not sure what it adds over the old one but Ig we'll find out.

nnem: C'mon, why is `#meeting=chat` so dead?

nngdu: They're not dead, they're j wait- for us to start, hehe. While we're wait- for them to get here, so hey. 'Crank', what? Craig! 

nnem: It's bcz of your accent.

Blodhgarm — Today at 12:04 AM
I would be chatting if I wasn't loading a trailer with wood

nngdu: Ustd[ blodhgarm. We nd lk an elevator music bot j while we're wait- for the first 5 mins. Sone PR tt to Cozy plz, I'm only half joking, hehe.

nnem: Instant DMCA

nngdu: Well it's been 5 mins so we might as well get started folks. So as alw, wlcm to the mtg. I'm your host, nngdu. This is the show whr the qns are made up and the pts are= Wait a min, tt's the wrong show. As alw, use `/ask` if you wanna ask a qn. We'll get to the qns towards the end of the mtg. Plz don't send a shitpost. We tend to get too many of those. We'll launch right into it, I thk.

nnem: Now nnsouth is mad at you bcz he'll hv to mk anor beep sound.

nngdu: Oh, well, right. Well, yk what, it's fine, hehe. They know how to do it now, hehe. Let's start off w pgbuto as alw. nncheat, are you thr?

nncheat: If I find the button, yes. So I'm the stand=in for nngli today as nngli is x4tun[[ unavbl. But look- at the Quilt Loom hist, there's 2 rlvt ths tt hppn_. Number 1 is, we got a PR merged by melog, Ig, add- metadata priorities. Which fr what I ustd is to be able to sel, or to choose whether fabric.mod.json or quilt.mod.json shld be used if a mod has both of them. I'm sure ppl who hvb desperately wait- for tt fetr know xk[ what it's abt. I'm x4tun[[ not xk[ sure. What I c tell you tho is tt nngli tonight = that is, 15 hours ago = merged usrm. Or, upd8_ it to usrm. So any chgs you see usrm shld also be avbl in the latest vrsn of Quilt Loom.

I thk one more th tt I c ment, hope[[ w/o build- pressure, is tt some of our volunteers have added pghs to Loom. So if tt goes thru, then hope[[ we c soon switch to pghs, which wld be neat. We'll see how tt goes.

nngdu: Tt wld be great. Thr's an itrs- PR open swhr, oh that's Loader, isn't it? We'll get thr. Alrt, thx nncheat. 

Next up, ttcotl, ig tt's me. Not a huge pile gg on. Obv[ we've been get- a lot of supt req on the comy server in the support channel. I set up Cozy to do some basic log parsing, so it curr[ dtks a few dffr[ potl prbms: Outdated qsl, outdated loader, and mods using Fabric inrls. So tt's still not q thr. It's alr help_ q a few ppl, which I'm happy w, despite it being as incredibly simple as it is. But if aone has any ideas for ath elseI cld add to it, tt wld be great. But so far, it's at least been smwt useful. 

ttcotl doesn't rly hv ath much else to talk abt. We're work- on a couple of ths tt we aren't rly rdy to talk abt yet. But they're small ths rly, so...

OK. So next up is Decompilers. nnsup would you lk to tk tt?

nnsup: Hello. Yes, thr's been some itrs- dev] gg on w QuiltFlower. We've rls_ QuiltFlower 1.8.0 which fixes lk 2 dozen bugs and adds q a few fetrs. We also decided tt this wld be a gd t to go more public w QuiltFlower so thr was a Reddit post we made which garnered q a lot of reception. So we're work- on anor upd8 rn to fix generic bugs. And if aone wld lk to help out, or if they're itrs_ in Decompilers, thr's a few issues on the issue board for QuiltFlower tt are marked as 'good first issue'. Might be a fun place to start w. And I thk tt's it.

[Issues · QuiltMC/quiltflower · GitHub](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower/issues "https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower/issues")

nngdu: Thx for tt nnsup, I'll just link tt in the chnl for aone who doesn't know whr it is, here we go. Alrt, next up is Loader, and I blv nncheat is stand- in agn for tt one.

nncheat: I am the prfk stand=in, sorry, I forgot to click the button, whoops. So, I alr 4got, thr was j one th I wanted to ment. Well, first off thr's a lot of ths tt were fix_ duri the last week in Loader. Or bugfixes tt were dscv_ thx to ppl using it thx to our Beta. But tt's nice. At this pt, first off, ty to eone who's reporting those bugs, report- all those issues. And second o/c, ty to all the ppl who fixed those issues. Lemme j qk[ chk the Qload repo if thr's an impt th I missed. No. So yeah, thx for tt. 

Thr's also q anor big th tt's hppn- w Qload tt I thk wld make q a lot of ppl happy and prob also some ppl upset. A new PR is open. It's PR #73. Nbdy knew it was happen- until it happened, except nnhav who made the PR. nnhav opened a PR to add a config sys to Qload islf. I've alr made q a thorough rvw and it looks pretty cool. So this will obv[ be q a big deal to hv. Not j a first=party config sys in Quilt, but also hv it part of Loader. Which means tt other tools = like CHASM foreg in futr = will also hv access to the same config sys. 

Now I know thr's alw a big deb8 about what config file to use, but now nnhav first add_ JSON5 bcz it was the easiest to add, and then add_ TOML, which is now the default. But it can also parse JSON5. And eone h the option to add their own config parsers. If you thk your config file parser is j superior to all the other options, feel free to make a parser yslf. Yeah, if aone's itrs_ in how tt wld psbl[ look in the API, or if you hv some input you want to add, go look at the PR. nnhav is rly on top of fix- ths, which is amzg. So hope[[ we cld hv this in an FPC soon, and then also merged, then eone has a std config lib, which wld hope[[ mk the whole sys a bit less spilt up. 

nngdu: Sounds great to me. It's rly an exciting PR to see finally open after the, well, mths of dscs], hehe.

nncheat: Yeah, Ig nnhav j dcd_ it's enuf.

nngdu: Yeah, I thk so. 

nncheat: Which is the right mv for sure.

nngdu: I agree. Alrt, ty for tt nncheat, was tt eth?

nncheat: I thk tt was eth.

nngdu: Alrt, fabulous, thx for tt. Alrt, mv- on, ttmap. nnem wld you lk to talk abt tt?

nnem: Yeah. So thr's been exactly one itrs- th tt hb add_ to the 1.18.2 mapg tt chg_ one of the a structure names to a much more accu name. But other than tt, we haven't rly been doing much other than match- betw pgss. So QM is still being rls_ for pgsss. and other than tt, the only th we rly hv to say is tt we're alw look- for Mapg Triage mmbrs. Even if we're not doing tt much rn, we're still look- for more Mapg Triage. So send a msg in `#mappings=general` if you are at all itrs_.

nngdu: Thx v much for tt, nnem. For qsl, nnaurora wld you lk to talk abt tt?

nnaurora: Thr's not a lot of stuff tt has hppn_ mainly in qsl. But pts are, the Recipe API got fixes bcz in the og[ PR thr was some stuff tt hb 4goten, and was not csdr_ initially. Which caused the recipes tt were reg_ thru the API to not work properly with the recipe book, and to also not be properly stored in the client ~~bt~~. 

Then, Common Lib got renamed to Mng] Lib. This has alm no consequences for most other ppl. The only consequence is if you are a dev and use the manual Maven artifacts, then you wld j nd to chg one th, and only one th. The rename was done so we c also patch other stuff lk Permissions API w/o worry- too much abt the scope. O/w, the merged PR also is the transitive access wideners for Block Constructors which got merged. This bsc[ means: so when you hv qsl in your dev] envt, a lot of the prev[ prot_ ctors and blocks are now public. 

And the only notable ths are... the resource pack providers PR still needs tb merged. But, lately, no core mmbrs, we hv t to merge it. But it will be merged soon. Then there is the BiomeModifications API tt is now rdy for rvw. Thr was an issue but now it's fixed. And the Screen API= Or if you wanna be rly precise, the ScreenEvents API is in the final comment period, so soon it'll be merged unless thr is rly a big issue w it. Tt's kinda it for today.

nngdu: Thx v much for tt nnaurora. OK, for Quilted FAPI, nnem, do you hv ath to talk abt thr?

nnem: Yep. We hv a few rlss for QFAPI, most notable of which wld be Beta 13, the latest one, tt gets ard an issue w Windows Defender find- us as a virus, and also rdcs the file size by alm half a megabyte. Other than tt, thr is a PR open for better compat w BetterEnd and BetterNether tt cld use a couple reviews. But other than tt, not v much h hppn_ thr either.

I j sent the PR in the #meeting=chat.

nngdu: For ttcomy, you may have noticed that nnnocom hb promoted to full moderator aft j over 2 weeks in the trainee pos. It's been great work- w them. We thk they're gonna be great work- in the pos, and we hope y'all like them as well.

We're also on Mastodon now, asum- tt's how you pronounce it. We're on lgbt.tech=

nnem: Other way ard, tech.lgbt.

nngdu: Even btr, tech.lgbt. See, I c rmb ths. So if aone's using Mastodon, you c find us thr. I'l actl[ mk a link, thr we go. Yeah, we dcd_ to set up thr j as an altv for ppl tt want to get the sort of th tt we post but don't use Twitter or can't use Twitter, or j in case if Twitter dies in a fire after Musk bought it, or has bought it by now Ig. If you contact us thr, you'll prob be talk- to me, but yeah, we do use it, we keep it up to date. 

Alrt, b4 we get to the qns, thr's a few ths to talk about here. First of all, as one of Octal's mmbrs ment_, thr's a PR open for a Kotlin team. This is an RFC which dfns bsc[ a team for mng- Kotlin=spfc projs and a dfn] for some types of projs tt mb will come under tt team. It's been a fairly bz PR, I thk, or rltv[ at least. But yeah, if aone's itrs_ in tt, it's still a draft, but it wld great to get some further input on it. 

Add[[ we're plan- on move- our mtgs to... We've been talk- inrl[ abt how our devr mtgs  gg fwd shld be strc_ and how ths shld work. (You c airbrush them out, it's fine, hehe. I'm kidd-, you don't hv to do tt. What was I say-? Oh yes.) We're plan- on move- the devr mtgs ard. So we've been dscs- inrl[ a lil bit on how our mtgs shld look gg fwd. We're plan- on mv these mtgs = in the 4mat tt we hv now = to the comy server. They're gg to work the same way, pretty much. 

But tt's not gg tb the only th we're do-. We're also plan- on set- up indiv mtgs for spfc proj teams. Foreg I thk ytd, I thk it was, ytd the CHASM team had it here on the tlcn server. Those mtgs will hppn here on this server. nncheat wld you lk to qk[ pt at what hppn_ in tt mtg?

nncheat: Yes, and I even found the button. So as nngdu said, the public devr mtgs are q fun and q enjoy[.  Hwvr, we can't rly talk to each other abt stuff tt's hppn-. So the og plan of the devr mtgs was to get devrs to get tgt so they cld dcd on a direction for the proj. But since the dir] is pretty solid rn, tt h gone away, and thr's not rly an oppy to talk w fellow devrs unless we j randomly meet up in chat. Which is o/c psbl. 

So while the dev mtg will bcm even more of a comy=oriented public dev mtg, we're csdr- hv- test mtgs now. While not eone fully agrees w this, we made a test w the CHASM Team. So today we met, we talk_ for j over 1 hour abt the curr state of CHASM, what nds tb done and the futr. And it's last to j assign tasks, tt's not rly the pt of it. 

It's j so we c get the info out to each other, bcz rn I'm j a single person who rly knows what's hppn- w CHASM so tt's not great. So now we hv at least 3, mb 4 ppl who know what's hppn- w CHASM which is a gd start. And if this bcms more of a success, we might also start to advertise them a bit more. So while they're tknl[ public rn, we haven't rly annc_ awhr tt it's hppn-. But in the futr we might do tt, so tt ppl c join in and listen and get a more in=depth idea of what actl[ hppns. 

The idea of tt wld o/c then be if aone is itrs_ in ctrb- to CHASM, tt's a gd place for them to j hop in and listen to what's hppn- and mb get some kinda ustd- of what's gg on. J to show this to you, this is also pubilc. It's also pinned in the `#chasm-chat`. I'll mk a HackMD whr we c j take notes as we talk and this will be gd for futr ref]. While it's not proper documentation, it's at least some documentation. It shld also help other teams in get- an ustd- of what's gg on. Spfc[ the Outreach Team is tasked w the dfcl chlg of get- info from devrs.

nngdu: Tt'll mk sense to me.

nncheat: It's nice bcz I ~thought this would be too much to ramble~. So yeah, if aone is itrs_ in what's hppn- w CHASM, the next mtg is skdl_. It's prob gonna be on May 16th, 5 PM UTC. It might mv an hour bwd or fwd dpd- on how the actl team ppl are avbl. But if you're itrs_ in hear- a bit abt what's gg on w CHASM more in dtl, abt the tknl chlgs and more than j a qk status upd8 lk we usually do here, feel free to join us in the tlcn Discord and j in our dev] chnl.

nngdu: Yeah. If aone's itrs_ in CHASM, obv[ go to the mtgs. The other teams are lkly to skdl their own mtgs soon as well. Ig we'll prob post those up in `toolchain=news` swhr, we'll figr it out anw. But if tt hppns, thr'll be more info avbl on tt. Now o/c, we hv one other big piece of news. Shld I tell them nncheat? Idk they're rdy for it.

nncheat: Ahh, yk, Idk if *we* are rdy for it. 

nnem: Mb j hold it off until next week.

nncheat: Yeah, mb we shld wait a bit.

nngdu: Enuf, I'm not feel- mean today. You're gonna know imd8 what it is once I start talk- abt it. But pretty much since the start of the comy server, or when it was made public at least, ppl hvb ask- abt creating a forum as an altv for Discord. And also for btr places to talk abt this in long=form, or j hv ths ezr to dscv or search for. It's been a long t in the mk-, we did a huge amt of research into it: Look- at dffr[ types of forums, what we nd_ for a forum, how moderation was gg to work, and o/c how it was gg tb hosted. 

For tt last pt, sone pretty much eone here is fmlr w, the Starchild sys offered to bsc[ do all the host- and setup work for a forum for us. An offer we've gladly accepted. So as of Ig last week, we've had sth to play w and Ig set up. So Ig what I"m trying to say is, go ahead and sign up. It's rdy. We hope you get as much fun out of using it as we had in set- it up.

nnax: Yes, qload does scan the classpath for mods alr, so yes, it j works bsc[.

Which intermediaries does QM use right now?

nnem: The ans to tt is pghs. QM islf does use pghs, but we hv a plugin = Qmap only = tt actl[ chgs tt so tt when you're compiling your mod, it compiles to pgim. Bc tt's what qload uses rn. So hopefully soon enuf we'll get some sort of compiling to pghs and also using pghs in qload. But for now, QM islf uses pghs, but chgs too.

Will Quilt have permissions in the way Android does? So a mod would require a certain permission to perform an action with files, etc

nnaurora: One th tt I og[[ did agn, hmmm. So thr's 2 ways of perms, so thr's server perms, but tt's not lk Android. Server perms is sth tt we will hv, bcz it's v impt. But for client stuff, lk Android, tt won't be a th tt we will do bcz bsc[ it's not a sandbox envt. If you want tt, we wld nd to sandbox eth which is not psbl in the curr state. And it j isn't realistic to do that.

nncheat: I thk j to clarify a lil bit on this: It's also rly hard to j do perms lk tt in Java. Thr is curr[ a mknm for tt, thr is a comy mngr, but it's deprecated and supposedly not being replaced. So Idth it's psbl rly.

nnaurora: Yeah, it's rly difficult in Java. If you rly wanted to do it, it wld nd sth lk= It wld req ea mod tb sandbox=ed bsc[, so it can't lk access the file sys while gg thru our sys. And tt's rly dfcl. I'm not rly sure it's even worth it, bcz in the decades of mod-, it's j a game of trust. It's been a decade lk tt. So I'm not sure if it's rly worth spend- a lot of t try- to chg tt. I thk thr's more impt ths to attd to for now.

Will Quilt have built-in telemetry? Such as ways to track it's own user counts, exclusive users, etc

nnaurora: I thk I'm pretty confident to say tt we won't hv ath lk tt. First of all, we hv a lot of users who wld be straight=up against it. And if you look at the clients in the modlist and the server, thr was a lot of debacle. And agn, it's not rly worth it. Fabric doesn't do it, Idk the state of Forge. The only stuff I know tt colk stats is some Bukkit plugins, and even that... Thr's a lot of ppl who don't apc8 it, so I might be confident to say tt Quilt won't hv built=in telemetry.

Deftu — Today at 12:35 AM
Forge does do it

nngdu: I hv to agree w you, I j can't see it hppn- personally. I'm sure some 3rd=party might come up w sth, but it's dfnt[ not sth we're itrs_ in, as far as I've seen anw.

nncheat: Also, we alr hv plenty of stats on Discord. I thk nngdu is satisfied w tt.

If thr will be separate dev meetings in future, are there any plans to scale up the recordings?

nngdu: Well, if thr are gg tb separate mtgs, I thk it's ulti[ gg to be down to the team run- the mtg to dcd how they want to do it. Now we do hv Craig on both servers. I blv they shld be able to use Craig if they wished to, so thr's no rsn tt thr can't be recordings. It's unlikely tt nnsouth as our only editor wld hv t to edit these recordings, j bcz thr's gonna be more of them and yk, they tk a lot of work. So it's hard to say spfc[ what's gg to hppn.

Are there any plans for QSL modules for purely server side modding? Or is that out of scope of the project?

nnaurora: Bsc[ thr will be the Perms API which is purely server=side, tt literally isn't useful in client. Except if you open the client in a single=player world, but tt's kinda a v niche case. It's supt_ by the API. But bsc[ for the server=side mod-, thr might be... Ik tt Patbox wants to write some stuff in the regy module to supt server=side modded items and blocks. So it doesn't try to regy=sync server=side only reg entries. I'm sure there will be other APIs, I can't tell rn what. But thr will be others. It's not out of scope of the proj. As long as it's not lk rly, rly niche= As long as it helps to build mods in a more compat way, it's wlcm.

If issues were to occur or there was enough of an outcry for support with something, would an in-house fix be implemented? Like how Forge supports/supported(?) OptiFine

nnaurora: Tt eg wld be q simple to ans bcz dfnt[ won't be an in=house fix. It's kinda not our job in that case. It's such an edge case, a complicated case tt no, it's not our job.

I think to clarify on the BiomeModifications question, I was curious how come it took so long to update it since 1.18 was first released. Like I think Fabric also struggled with it for a while.

Finn: Yes I am. The fact is atm, the fapi is ported over to Quilt. We will soon write our own or do heavy modifications to it. But atm it is j the fapi and Idk why they took so long. You wld hv to ask thr and why it took them so rltv[ long.

Will QSL be fully thread-safe, or will extra effort have to be put in by the developer using it to ensure that they're using whatever it is they're using on the main thread?

nncheat: I actl[ thk I kinda wanna talk abt this. I thk in gnrl it's the devr's job. So ppl are lk= No one's entirely sure in the inrl chat, so don't tk this as a dfnt ans, I'm not even on the qsl team. But the way I see it is, you're using 2 APIs when mod- MC. One is MC islf, and the other is qsl. And MC is inherently not thread=safe. You hv alw to chk yslf. Thr's v few sitns or ntwk- code, but they add some chks to mk sure you're on the corek thread or wtvr. But in gnrl it's a devr's job. And I thk it's dngr[ to asum in MC tt any API is thread=safe. If you're a devr who adds multi=threading to your mod, be aware tt this is your own fault. I'd say j be v careful. Double=check the APIs. Again, QSL is not the only API whr you wld use it.

nnaurora: I wld add to this tt it also deps on API bcz qsl is a set of APIs, it's not a uniq one. Some APIs might contain quite safe fetrs, but it's not guaranteed. And if sth is thread=safe, I thk it wld be said within the Javadocs. We can't rly mk a guarantee fo the whole of qsl.

nngdu: Alrt, thx for tt, you two. We hv curr[ rch_ teh end of our list of qn, so if aone h ath they want to ask fr any team = not j the devrs btw = If you're curious abt ath, plz do go ahd and use `/ask`. We still hv abt 15 mins.

nnem: This is whr the elevator music PR wld come in. 

nngdu: Yeah, it wld be q handy, wouldnt it?

nnem: Wld tt be nnaurora's one agn?

nngdu: I thk tt wld be nnaurora's, yeah.

nncheat: It shows how popr qsl is.

nngdu: Hmm, what a great t to get a phone call.

nncheat: Yk I was thk- b4, aft you ment_ at teh start whr we lk alw wait 5 mins whr we were thk- of play- elevator music? Cld be kinda cool to istd lk= You can't screenshot in stage chnls, but it wld be kinda cool to showcase some stuff at the start. We cld lk show some art, or lk show new mods, j to bridge the t. Tt's hard of course w/o screen=sharing.

nngdu: It wld be q nice. But it's hard w/o screen=sharing, yeah.

Stupid Quetion Here(Sorry): How easy is it to get a Fabric mod working with Quilt and how much time would such take?

nnem: As sbdy who's ported mtpl of my mods fr Fabric to Quilt, it's rly not tt much work. Most of the stuff h dir[ eqvt classes where used. If you don't want port your mod dir[ to Quilt, the Fabric vrsn of your mod prob works fine. Lk thr's a pinned msg in the `tech=support` chnl over on the comy server, and I thk rn we have less than a dozen mods tt work on Fabric but don't work on Quilt. So all in all, it's not tt much work, and you don't even hv to if you don't want to .

nngdu: Alrt, thx for tt. I'll tk this one.

With the OpenCollective, is Quilt looking or open to sponsors from large servers / companies? 

nngdu: Usually we hv an Admin to ans this qn, so don't tk what I say as gospel. This is what I've colk_ fr dscs]s inrl[. But we are work- w a couple of grps. Lk sponsorships are not sth we're ptcr[ against. We hv one from 1Password which we use for storing our credentials and stuff in a way tt's spfc for each team. We got a sponsorship from the Starchild sys, which you'll see on the website once they hv a website for their own and stuff. They're host- the forum. 

Pretty much eth else comes out of nnhav's pocket and a small amt from mine as well. So lk, we're not against it if there are lk companies tt wanna help w tt. Ideally we wld prefer sponsorships tt are lk monetary j bcz ctrl- the infra is impt to us. But yeah, we're open to talk abt it, as far as I've seen inrl[, so I don't see why not. If you wanna bring it up to an admin, I'm sure any of the 3 of them wld talk to you abt it. I'll tk this next one as well then while you all are dscs- tt. Well, if you wanna tk it, then go ahd and tk it.

Will there by additional APIs in QSL which will make creating multi-version mods easier? Such as what Architectury does with it's API

nnaurora: It's slightly dfcl to ans bcz thr's a lot of uncertainty curr[. The main th is first of all, once we got CHASM and we start use- uniq fetrs from it, thr's some likeliness tt some APIs won't be as useful in tt case. Bcz if other modloaders don't spot the same injk] methods, issues will hppn. 

The other th is a lot of APIs are made w the Quilt philosophy, if you c call it tt. It's a bit derived fr the Fabric philosophy of last year, which is xtrm[ dffr[ from the Forge philosophy. And bsc[ what tt means is tt multi=vrsn stuff is rly dfcl. The th tt hppns is = at least for a multi=vrsn alone = is we prvd stable APIs, but not too stable. Bcz in pgsss, what c hppn is we brk some APIs if and only we nd to mk chgs to mk it either btr bcz in the last iteration we missed some stuff. Or if foreg MC wipes it bcz it doesn't lk, ~it means their only use is to kp a broken API ard~, so it will rly rly dpd.

If MC doesn't chg much, and if the API doesn't nd to evolve, then it'll hv some stability guarantees. O/w for multi=loader stuff, it rly dpd. But a lot of APIs won't rly be usable on other loaders. Thr might be some APIs tt at one t might work on other loaders, but thr's abs[ no guarantee on tt. They're not in a state whr we can ans more on this. It's sth we will hv to see w time.

nngdu: Alrt, fab, thx for tt. I'll tk the next one. Actl[ we're pretty close to the end, so I'm gg to finish the AmA to mk sure we hv enuf t to get thru this qn, but I thk we will. Thx nnaurora, thx for tt. Oh, tt didn't work at all. Why didn't it? I can't send the qn to the chnl, but Deftu asks, "Is it psbl for Quilt to partner w larger mod devrs/dev groups to bnft each other?"

nngdu: This is a bit of a broad qn IMO. Thr's a couple of ths to thk abt here. On the one hand we do work w some groups on the issues of moderation specifically. Lk foreg we work with Forge at Comy Collab to work on events and moderation ths. On the other hand, if you're talk- abt lk PRs and ths on Github, it's kinda dfcl to say. We're in a pos whr we hv an open enuf sys whr we hope to avd favouritism. 

It's ustd[ gg tb dfcl to blnc tt w the nds of larger dev groups .Obv[ we want be as accommodating as long as we can. As long as tt doesn't hppn to the detriment of well, your regular user or ctrbr.

Everyone should get good treatment, not only big developers, is the point

That doesn't mean we won't work w bigger devrs o/c, but we do wanna prioritise eone, not j spfc grps in our dcd]=mk-. I thk tt abt covers the rough philosophy anw.

Alrt thx eone. Thx for your qns and thx for coming. We'll be doing this agn in 2 weeks on the comy server istd of the tlcn server. We'll put an annc] out to tt efk once we hv eth set up. And in the mntm, thx for coming. As alw, I'm sure thr'll be an after=party in the voice chnls here. Or mb even on [the comy server] if you're lucky. And uh yeah, thx for coming. We hope to see you all agn next time. If you hv any fdbk on the forum or ath else tt has hppn_, j contact one of us. We'll be glad to hear abt it. See ya eone, we'll see ya in 2 weeks.

nnem, nncheat: See ya.
