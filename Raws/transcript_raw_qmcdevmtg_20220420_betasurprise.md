nngdu: 5 mins of so, mk sure tt more participants are able to join. But b4 all tt it's t to get Craig=ed. We're now being Craig=ed. 

Quet'd? (T/N: Quilt + Beta) I said Craig=ed. I'll xpln tt in a min. Craig and Giarg?

Are you in here, nnkrop? Are you able to join teh stage on your own, or do I nd to pull you up? OK, how abt now? Nice, hi nnkrop. B4 we get started, I'd like to ask all participants to join the stage. You all nd tb up here bcz of how we've got this setup. I'll try to drag ppl up but I might miss some.

How many do we have? 14?

Beta buzz, guys. It's alm t to get started. Alrighty. Well, wlcm to the stage eone. I asum= we don't hvv a full set of participants, but I asum they'll be in and out. I asum eone c hear my cough, OK.

Alrighty. So we're j gonna start off gg who's on stage atm and what we do. I know a couple of you don't hv mics and tt's fine. I know most ppl know who I am as comy mngr. nnoct is part of our team, doing events. nnaliz is another one of our moderators working hard to put this tgt. nncheat do you wanna go over waht you do?

nncheat: I'm a devr work- mainly on CHASM and pgbuto. I've been work- on mapg stuff too.

nnkrop: I'm nnkrop. I help out with CHASM and decopmiler.

nnax: I'm nnax. I work on qload mostly.

nnaurora: Hi I'm nnaurora. I'm a devr and mianly a QSL core maintainer and also part of the ttmap. 

nngdu: TYVM. You're a lil bit quiet thr, I asum it's j mic dist tho. Right then, let's get start_ shall we? We hv a set of qns picked up fro our Google Form. It's been posted in our `#announcements` chat for a few days. I'm gg to pick a few qns, and then pick one of you to ans it. The other, we'll do a sort of round-table format.

"What does Quilt entering Beta actl[ mean?""

nncheat: Tt's a big qn rly. In short, qbeta was a target for devrs to get stuff gg so tt the comy c do sth w Quit and we can get fdbk. So we set a ddln to make it public so tt we can't j kp push- it off. For most of the comy it means tt you c use quilt to lk code mods. So use qmap on qsl on qqload. So qmap hb out now for how long?

nngdu: A few mths, rly. "So what wld you say are the next ths tb work_ on during beta?" At least on your end.

nncheat: Ig if you don't speak to a person spfc[, I'll j speak agn. For me, it's mostly CHASM. I want to get CHASM work-. In a modd- env it means get it runn- on qload, runn- on Loom. Mixins is a bigger proj.

nngdu: I've crtn[ seen a few projs ppl worked on post=Beta. The installer is a big one. Not a big one but dfnt[ needs doing. Zoe is work- on the erorrs, or making the errors look nicer. Not sure of the other teams, but doesn't aone else need ath tt needs look- at aft the tart of beta?

nnax: For qload, it's to make sure tt it's runn- and can handle most sitns fairly well, rather than having work tt nds tb done on it.

nncheat: Mapg, we rly want it to get work- on the fully auto=upd8- as well. The upd8- of mapg is being done e week w/o much human input, so we're hope- to chg tt rly soon.

nngdu: Alrt, let's move onto a round-table format.

"What was the hardest mo=oment in quilt's dev] for you?"

nncheat: The hardest moment? E t I work on Gradle, ig. Ig tt's the correct ans. If they wanna talk abt sth that is rel_ to pdtn, then IDK. CHASM hb fairly smooth other than some rly hard thk- at the start. But once tt was done it was rly ez so far.

nngdu: Tt's gd. Crtn[ seems there was a lot less friction than we xpk_ w it. nnkrop, your turn.

nnkrop: IDK rly. ????

nncheat: J say more abt the CHASM th. Say more abt the terminology while talk- about it for 3 hrs. J use dffr[ words.

nngdu: Ig. nnax?

nnax: The most dfcl part was kp- it usrm to kp it compat w Fabric. nngli did most of tt, but the work still had tb done.

nngdu: nnaurora? No, do we hv mic death? Yep. She'll be back in a min. Wlcm back.

nnaurora: It was mostly Quilted fapi. Bcz for a long while I was the only one mntn- it and it was q dfcl. O/w it was and it still is mapp- as a prcs. Bcz port- the mapg to a new vrsn is still kinda dfcl bcz we're use- kinda sketchy tools as well. But IDK rly what else.

nngdu: Tt's alrt. OK, the nxt qn I hv is another round-table.

"What is or was your fvr[ part of Quilt to work on?"

nncheat: My fvr[ part? I'd thk Gradle, but it's both true and wrong. It's rly annoy- to work w, but I lk the chlg. IDK, so it's a love=hate rlsp. CHASM was actl[ q fun, onc you got past the complicated stuff. Thr were a lot of chlg, but most of them w rly smooth ???. CHASM=Lang also, in gnrl.

nnax: Prob Quiltflower, bcz it's lk a huge codebase and e time you go into it, you find new stuff to discover. It's kinda lk a cplx puzzle tt nds fix- in places.

nnaurora: My fvr[ parrt, I wld say, I hv not a lot of fvr[ parts. I would say first is when we switched to using Mumble for mtgs. My other fvr[ parts is when ?? bcm usable and when Recipe API got merged.

"Why rls Quilt on Apr 20th?"

nngdu: It's a Beta rls rather than a stable rls, let's mk tt clear. But coincidentally the day we opened this to the public was 4/20 last year. So I figr_ it was a good date to open the Beta after a year. But a lot of ppl

nncheat: Tbf, one of the rsns I voted fo rthe date was bcz it was ez to rmb. Some ppl wnate to push it back to Sat or Sun, but 4/20 is so ez to rmb e year. If you want anniversaries, it's ez to rmb. Funny number is ez to rmb, so tt's good.

"How or why did you get ivlv_ w Quilt in the first place?"

nngdu: I actl[ didn't hear abt Quilt until aft a couple of mths aft the proj started. This kinda surprises a lotta ppl bcz I kind ended up being the face of it. But the rsn I bcm the comy mngr is bcz ppl asked me to do it, and tt's why.

Octal/Tubbo, you said you wanted to ans this one?

I thk Discord is j fight- w our mics today. Tt's alrt, we'll cont on until you figr out your mic issues.

nnaliz: C you hear me? Mostly it was just nngdu talk- about this th called Quilt over and over agn in comy servers, so I thot, what is Quilt. It seemed lk an itrs- proj so I got ivlv_.

nncheat: I don't rly know, tbh. I wasn't thr at teh v start. But I heard abt it I thk, mb lk day 2 or 3 of the Discord server aft gg public. After tt I tried look- at the tlcn and sniff- ard.

nngdu: "This is my proj."

nncheat: Well, nnearth started on this proj and I kinda picked it up.

nngdu: As alw.

Octal: I was= The rsn I got intro_= I got started w Quilt stuff was tt I was rlvt[ new to modd- at the t. And I had heard abt Quilt and the ppl bhd it, and i thot, yeah, I agree w tt. And when the Quilt Discord server bcm public, it bcm one of my fvr[ communities, and I applied to bcm a comy mngr.

nnsouth: "Even though I'm not on the stage, I want to answer this:
I got an invite to quilt in gdude's now dead Fabric Community server and a few months down the line decided to apply for moderation :pineapple:"

nnkrop: I thk my story is mostly the same as Octal?

nnaurora: So for me I hv a hist w Fabric. Bcz I was ivlv_ in Woven, which kinda was lk Quilt but also dffr[. It was not sucd][ but it led to some itrs- stuff. I thk ivlv- stuff and some dislike of Fabric tt started to settle in mslf. Then suddenly in Mar of last year, I get a msg from nnsup inviting me to the famous Quilt Initiative Discord server, which was ???, and tt's how I got ivlv_.

nngdu: Ty. I see pgsnz has dcd_ to drop in.

pgsnz: I thk I j saw it in various dffr[ modd- comy, and I thot it look_ itrs-. Then I thot it look itrs- and dcd_ to join. Not as itrs- as the rest of you.

nnax: I'd been look- to impv Buildcraft. First I went to Fabric, but thr were a few controversies tt I won't go into. Then I moved to Quilt, mostly bcz a few ppl I worked with moved to Quilt. Though I was thr from the bgn-.

nngdu: Thr's a few qns next. "Official Quilt eg mod when?"

Hope[[ today. It's one of the ths I've been wait- on b4 makin an annc]. Oh, I've been pinged. It's been done apar[. Nbdy told me tt. Thr's a link in the chat.

(nnoct: "It is ready, [GitHub - QuiltMC/quilt-example-mod: Official Quilt example mod.](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-example-mod "https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-example-mod")")

"Is thr Quilt-Fabric link?"

I was hoping nngli wld be here. Patchwork will be a thing. Loader plugins would mk load- Fabric a lot more feasible on Quilt. Sth is coming, not fr us, but it's coming. nncheat, mb you wanna ans this for variety.

"Why don't we kp bwd compat w Fabric?"

nncheat: Ig I haven't been talk- enuf yet. Tt's cute. The ans to tt is, we do. In gnrl, we don't hv a ddln of "We must supt Quilt istd of a Fabric vrsn for one year or sth". We j don't want to hv to supt Fabric, only as long as it bnfts us. Hope[ Quilt will bcm the bigger modloader, and then thr'll be no rsn to supt a modloader tt's smaller. Evidently tt's not true now, but when it is, we'll drop Fabric.

Ig this is for nnaurora. "Why do we nd QSL as an extra mod even tho we also nd qload?"

nngdu: Ig nnaurora is hv- mic prbms again.

nnaurora: Oh no, I j got confused by the qn. The rsn is simple. The modloader is much= Made to work across a lot of dffr[ MC vrsns at once. While QSL is made for only one. It'll upd8 w e vrsn of MC. Thr'll alw be sth tt breaks it. So mk- it ??? is much btr bcz it reqr much less of the qload and stuff. O/w= For now it's an extra mod, and it's smlr to how Fabric has fapi and the Fabric loader split. Foreg Forge too tries to work twd a split lk tt. Bcz it's j much more ezr to mng. And also kinda ezr for eone to mntn.

"When do you plan to work on docs and when will they replace the Fabric one?"

Docs are kinda split into two parts. First is for devrs. We do hv docs for QSL, they's not on Maven but they'll get thr soon. As for sth lk Fabric wiki, nnoro hb work- on sth lk tt. He'll be thr in about 30 seconds. J got confirmation, he'll be over to tell us more abt tt. As for user docu], I wld hope to expand those to a proper wiki as well, but we still hv work to do on those.

nnoro: Yes, so for the devr wiki, a lot of ppl hv express_ their issues w how the Fabric wiki is 4mat_, how the code is outdated, written for 1.15 but now it's 1.18. So for the devr wiki the code h tb able to compile, since the code is actl, real code tt is used to xpln what's gg on. Byd tt I haven't done too much prototyping. Bsc[ it's one massive Gradle proj tt turned into a webpage based on what I've done so far. It shld be btr than Fabric wiki, and btr than Forge wiki so tt we hv the best wiki of all the modloaders.

nngdu: Lofty goals but I'm sure you c get thr. I thk this one is for you too.

"Compared to other modding platforms like Forge, Fabric, Sponge, etc, what would you summarise Quilt's value proposition as?"

What do you think of this nnoro? Ig it's ask- what we hv over them.

nnoro: Quilt is swhr betw Forge and Fabric. Forge is v strict, API is practially forced. They've started moving away from tt w their loader. ??? Fabric has a flxb API. Bnft of strong central API w Forge but a lot of the flxb] tt Fabric prvds. Some of the other devrs you can try to say sth.

nngdu: I wld say CHASM wld be a big part of Quilt's value proposition when it comes ard.

nncheat: I hope so. It's a bit awkward bcz j say- CHASM, to most ppl it's j confusing .But bsc[ the goal is to allow the comy to mk sth lk Mixin Extras w/o= Mixin Extras allows [you] to make sth cplt[ new w/o reqr ??? in Loader. You don't hv to wait for us to prvd loader injection, you c j do it yslf. Which I thk is rly impt for long=term mntn].

Alrt, nxt qn then. "If you had to gv one rsn why to choose Quilt over another modloader?" Tt sounds lk an admin qn to me, nnoro.

nnoro: So, fr a player perspective, thry[ thr shld be v lil chg. It shld feel lk Fabric, to the pt whr you c tk your favr[ Fabric pack and mod up. We're not q thr yet, bcz some modders use itrs- ways to get their mods work-. You also, as a player, shld hope[ be able to ustd the issues btr, esp srrd- modloading. Some ppl hv express_ concerns over Fabric's= If you';re missing a mod, tt loading screen cb confusing for new players. So hope[ Quilt's screen is a lot more dscb[ and ezr to ustd.

For devrs, we hope to hv a larger API than Fabric. So take Fapi and expand and impv on tt. So a lot of the modules in qsl are practically 1=to=1 w Fabric and hv extra stuff on top of them. Then, qmap are a lot clearer. Fabric has a cleanroom policy, so ????, makes it a lot harder to gert help for cross=platform work. Qmap got rid of the cleanroom policy, ???.

A lot of the constants in the game are a lot harder to figr out, but w Mojmap we c now see what tt is

nncheat: I thk the qn was a bit mis=understood. I thk it was abt one th.

nnoro: The #1 th for a player=

nncheat: I thk the ans for a player shld be fairly ez: Btr mods. Bcz we are mostly devr=focused, and from the Quilt devr side, most of the Quilt devrs are mod devrs, so obv[ trgt- a lot of ths btr for mod devrs. So ath tt makes ths btr for mod devrs mk it evtl[ btr for players.

nngdu: I've been suspiciously tagged in. "Will it come to MultiMC?"

Peterix said tt he'll csdr merging it when it bcm a bit more popr. I thk it's still psbl to get Quilt work- if you're on the special instance. If you're on the tlcn server, I thk thr's a special instance pinned, but you hv to get the JSON set up which is kinda a pain. 

If you're look- for an altv, you c use PolyMC (T/N: A recent MultiMC fork) but I know tt some ppl are unhappy w tt. We're aim- for launcher cvrg so hope[[ we'll see.

This is an itrs- one, but I'll excuse mslf. "If you cld bring a shulker box of items from MC into the real world fr survival, what wld you bring?"

nnax: Oh, tt's a dfcl qn. Ig 27 stacks of gold blocks is an ez one. Or mb gold ingots, they wld be ezr to sell. 

nngdu: Modded item?

nnax: Too many possibilities. A lot of fun in the real world, but also dnagerous. Ender portals wld be a bit danger[, gg to hell and all. I don't think MC is suited the real world.

nngdu: I thk most ans wld be some vary] of gold or diamonds.

pgsnz: Elytra and fireworks seem fun. Enchanting table too. Put a pencil inside and get Unbreaking 5 on it. Oh, it nds to break though.

nncheat: If you wear pants, you shld put Mending on it or sth.

nnaurora: 27 items is q a lot. One th I wld bring is a trident. I think I wld bring a bucket of axolotl. And a shulker box of shulker shells, to mk more shulker boxes. The qn is whether I can craft stuff w what I bring or not. 

nngdu: But I blv tt was the case, tho it's not mentioned.

nnaurora: I wld bring wood blocks, shulker shells to craft more shulker boxes. Then if my IRL inv was as bad as MC inv= 

nncheat: It says no crafting allowed.

nnaurora: Oh, then a bundle, Ig. Tt's dfcl. Tt's rly dfcl so. I also wld bring some gold blocks for the same rsns (as nnax) and... IDK rly what else. And maybe some dimaonds too.

nngdu: Ok, nnkrop.

nnkrop: If I bring redstone components, c I make redstone in the real world?

nngdu: Tt's a gd one.

nnkrop: Whether I can buld ~~gators~~ or flying machines?

nnoro: The og[ qn said all other weird properties are fair game. So redstone would work.

nnkrop: So I wld mk rail dupers or carpet dupers. I wld bring a lot of activated rails, and then redstone wld be v useful for the railway. So ig mb tt. Then mb Elytra, rockets, mb some gold.

nncheat: I think nnkrop started on tt. Gimme a stack of redstone blocks and a stack of pistons, and I'll solve the world's prbm forever. Get- extra ??? j in case. Get some healing potions in thr. Yk they're gonna sell more than j a bunch of dimaonds. Bcz if you bring a stack of diam blocks they'll lose value. Thk of the econ. If modded is ok, sth tt teleports.

nnsnz: A beacon would be fun. I thk you gotta get some chorus fruit. You gotta find out what it taste lk. Mb an elytra?

nngdu: I thk I hv to agree on the elytra. Ig not very access[

nncheat: Ulti[, you wld die from the first landing.

nnaliz: I wld prob tk a respawn anchor and some glowstone. Imn, if they actl[ work, why not?

nnoct: Alrt, I thk I wld go w a shulker box cplt[ full of clay bcz of how OP it is.

nnoro: I thk most of the ppl hv said what most of hte vanilla items are. So a bucket of axolotl, elytra, a bunch of fireworks. Not many ppl talked abt modded, so I'm gg to talk abt tt. So you cld bring a bunch of emerald blocks, bring some villagers (in modded you can pick up villagers and stuff), then put them into the shulker box.

nngdu: All the rmn- ones I hv are trivial qns. ??? That's ok.

"What's your fvr[ MC update?"

nnax: I rly liked the Caves update. I q lk caving in MC. Having a lot of caves to go thru is rly cool.

nnaurora: I'm not tt sure. The rsn is bcz Ik tt thr hv to be one whr I hv tt spfc nostalgic feel, but I'm not rly sure. If I had to go for nostalgic, it wld be 1.4.7 bcz I started w it. But tknl[, it's 1.18 bcz I love the new worldgen and new blocsk.

nngdu: Alrt, tt makes sense. nnkrop?

nnkrop: Sorry, I had sth. Tt's a rly hard qn to ans. I don't rly thk I hv a fvr[ one. Mb the redstone update.

nngdu: Tt makes sense. nncheat?

nncheat: Ez, 1.13. Fr the modded perspective, I was j v glad when ??? broke off. And in gnrl, I thk the code since 1.13 has cleaned up a lot. It's j much more xtdb and such. I only started in modded after 1.13. But hv- to use block data to add more wood blocks. From a player perspective, the ocean update which was visually my fvr[ update so far. It j made the ocean so much nicer and added dffr[ biomes.

nnmango: Ig it wld be 1.16. I've been on MC a long time, but wasn't tt active for the whole time. 1.16 was the t I was play- a lot w friends, and the Nether update was good. And o/c it was gd for speeduning.

nngdu: I don't hv much cnnk] to modern MC. Even tho I write a couple of mods. I wld prob go w 1.13 bcz of the oceans. I wld be a cplt weirdo and talk abt MC classic. The resn is bcz I spent so much t in it. I've been play- MC since when it first existed, and I started a nice comy thr. And despite Mojang kinda kill- it, thr's still ppl play- it. So it's still viable.

nnaliz: I wld say 1.12 bcz tt's when Mojang chg the launcher. I ?????. I j rly lk those massive upd8 tt add sth to the game.

nnoct: I hv two ans to tt. Nostalgia rsns, 1.1 bcz tt's when I started playing. Gameplay, 1.16 bcz of the updated Nether.

nnoro: My fvr vrsn dfnt[ is 1.16. Lk nnmango said, I played a lot w my friends then. Mb bcz of Covid, but tt was dfnt[ a fun vrsn I played. Even tho I nvr played it v much, as a tknl player I rly lk_ 1.13. Cmd sys, ???. But all the chgs were rly itrs- to me and I was alw excited abt what they'd do next.

nngdu: "What is your personal fvr[ mod?" And to avd giving nnax anor heart attack, let's start fr the top.

nnoro: My personal fvr[ mod is my own mod. But byd tt... I was not xpk- to go first = I wld say Sodium. I rly love what **JellySquid**'s done. It's rly amazing and she's rly push- the limits of what graphic cards can do w MC. For mods... I don't rly hv a fvr[ mod, but my fvr[ modpack was Project Ozone 3 (T/N: Actually [PO2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAVDbMg_XAoIzvMEoPyg7mW0T0gDZezo)), esp **EthosLab**'s series tt rly got me into it.

nnoct: Ig my favr[ mod is Aurora's Decorations bcz of the thot put into every single fetr. For modpack, Ig Skyfactory 3 is one of my fvr[s.

nnaliz: I thk I wld say Create. I rly love automation games, and for me Create is the right middle ground betw MC and let's say Factorio.

nngdu: It' a v impressive mod I'd have to say. My long time fvr[ mod was actl[ Tabby Chat bcz of hte qol fetr. Dark Chronicles has a mod called ??? chat which is like Tabby Chat on steroids. So if I had to pick a fvr[ now, it wld hv tb tt.

(nnsouth: For the record, my favourite mod is the Carpet Mod, and the best console mod is the Lord of the Rings mod)

nnmango: I thk since 1.4. I'm not rly up=to=date on content mods. nnoro said Sodium is v cool.

nngdu: I hv to agree w what eone's say- abt Sodium. It's one of the most mind-blowing mods I've ever used.

nncheat: I hv to say one of the mods is Botania. Create also, tho I've never really played it. All the world crafting and avoid- inv crafting. It's not rly tt new any more. But it's not j using a simple machine whr you power it and item in, item out. It's a v creative approach to doing things.

nnkrop: ??? amazing. But I haven' t rly played modded for a long time. But for me, mb lk an ME system from AE2.

nnaurora: So one th to note is tt I'm pretty recent to modding. So thr's a lot of mods tt IDK. But so far, for my fvr[s, are Create, ???, Sodium, Aurora's Decorations, and ???.

nngdu: Moving onto potl[ the last qn= Sorry, I forgot abt you nnax.

nnax: Ig I don't have a fvr[ mod, nvm. It isn't tknl[ mine, but Ig Buildcraft. I'm mntn- it. It was nice to see items fly- ard in the pipes.

nngdu: So the next qn is the last qn I hv on my list. If aone has qns they want to ask but haven't for any rsn, I thk the form is still thr in the chnl. We'll try our best to get thru them, or nnaliz will try her best to get them to us. "What is your fvr[ dessert?"

nnoro: I was hoping you'd say tt, bcz I actl[ hv it w me. I'm gg to put a [pic](https://discord.com/channels/817576132726620200/966049030104821821/966399953247301652) of it in chat. So I'll let it upload. Ig the pic doesn't come up v well but it's a lemon bar. But the rsn it's my fvr[ dessert is bcz I love citrus, and lemon bars are abs[ amazing.

noct: I don't rly hv afvr[ dessert, so I'm gg to say ice cream.

nnaliz: I was look- at the qn. Mb some sorta choc cake. Ath choc=based is j awesome and eone shld try tt.

nngdu: Tt makes a lot of sense. It's kind of a trick qn for me, bcz rcnt[ I learned I was lactose intolerant. So I can't eat a lot of stuff now, but sth I found was ~~comfeterols~~.

nnmango: I'm not rly sure but I c confirm tt I do like desserts. 

nngdu: What if nnmango liked mangoes?

mango: Mangoes are good.

nncheat: I've not a huge sweet tooth, but thr are still plenty of desserts. So I'm gg to say apple strudel.

nnkrop: I can't choose, I'm lk= If I had to choose, it wld be biscuit pie. It wld be the same as a sugar bomb, a massive cherry bomb. It's j some biscuits, sugar and butter mostly.

nnaurora: For me, it wld be= thr's 2 of them. Firstly, choc cake. But not any one of them, j my mom's recipe. The other one, locally it's called drops. But if I tried to dscb it, it wld be choc chips in the shape of a ball.

nnax: I alw rly liked cheesecakes tbh. Tho I can't say no to choc=based puddings. Any of them, if they've got choc in, then I'll  tend to like it.

nngdu: Yeah, I kinda miss cheesecakes. We've got a couple more qns in.

"Who do you or did you look up to in modding?"

nnoro: I've only been modding since lk 1.16, and I kinda came in not rly know- what I was gg to do. and j started gg. So Ig thr's not rly aone I've been look- up to in tt sense. I kinda came from the technical side, ???, but Ig **Masa** too.

nngdu: I don't rly know who is or isn't a modder, so if you don't hv aone it's fine.

nnoct: Ig the two ppl I look up to the most is nnaurora nad **Fusion Flux** bcz of how smlr they are to me. I've been able to ustd the stuff they talk about and it j makes me rly happy.

nngdu: Tt is incredibly cute, ty.

nnaliz: I don't rly do modding, but prob the devrs of Quilt. It's j rly impressive to dev a modloader lk tt. It's j mind-boggling for sone who hasn't j looked at their work.

nngdu: I'm also not a huge modder, I've written a couple of mods but I wouldn't say. I'll go the cliche route and say **asie**, and bcz I've known them such a long time and they've beeninvovled in some itrs- porject. Maybe **Eloraam** from Redpower bcz of how large tt mod was.

nnmango: Not really modding, but I've done RNG changing for speedrun tournaments, and I'll avd the obv joke. (T/N: Dream scandal)

nncheat: I hv not done a lot of modding in lke a while. I haven't rly looked too deep inteh modding comy. For modpacks, I'm a huge fan of Sevtech by Darkosto, unless I'm cplt[ rmb- it wrong. Who has a rly cool dsin in their modpacks. So to tt xtt I kinda need to make a modloader. Making mods tt ppl enjoy, I find tt inspiring. Hard to choose j a few ones.

(asie: "personally, i honestly have pahimar to thank the most. fixing EE2's dupe bugs in 1.1 Tekkit is how i got into modern-era Minecraft modding (edited)")

nngdu: Yeah, thr's so many good ppl out thr.

nnaurora: Ig I wld say DD. But for a long t I didn't know who **asie** was. But **asie** is dfnt[[ one of the others I look up to.

nnax; I've alw look_ up to **SpaceToads**, not bcz he made BuildCraft. But bcz he alw seemed approachable. Not lk we rly talked much, we didn't overlap time=wise. But tt's why I'm here.

pgsnz: Eone of hte qsl team are fanta[ smart ppl. nnsup? Decompilers, tt code base is one of the best codebases I've ever read. I'm not v good at modding actl[, started in Dec. Also shoutout to nnaurora. The entire team as well, the whole team in gnrl is also super brilliant.

nngdu: "What did you work on right before you started work- on Quilt?" nnoro, how's your WiFi?

nnoro: If the connection is etbh_ it works. If I try to make a new connection it doesn't work. Right before Quilt, let's see, trying to rmb. So I thk a month before rule #9, I thk I had j got ont hte Yarn Triage Team. And so I was slowly transitioning from being a more= I only made one mod, Netherite Plus. I made some other mods but they had a couple hundred DLs each. So I ended up taking Netherite Plus and a lot of the stuff was v Mixin=heavy. Then I started get- ivlv_ in tlcn. So lk de=hardcoding items so tt you could have cstm items, cstm bows, stuff lk tt. Don't rly rmb what got me into it, sth lke World Events tt got me onto Pick and Yarn at the same t. And once Quilt hppn_  I was lk, I wanna join Quilt and tt's what happned_

nnoct: B4 I joined Quilt, I was j thk- of lrn- how to mod stuff which is not rly much. I started a couple projs b4 I joined the ??. Mainly I'm work- w ??Boy from Geyser, making an addon to Geyser tt ppl on Bedrock use to join modded servers.

nnaliz: I'm personally new to the MC comy. B4 tt I was work- on the Python Discord server. I had some fun thr, but for some rsn it stopped, so I dcd_ to move and I found Quilt. And this is a fun time.

nngdu: I thk at least 10 ppl know what I"m gg to say, but it's what I was doing int hte downtime betw Fabric and Quilt at the time. So I got into Kotlin, and thr wasn't rly many Discord bots tt used Kotlin, so I got started on KordEX. I can't rly rmb what else i was working on, but tt's what I was spend- most of my time before get- headhunted here.

nnmango: Ig a lot of speedrunning. I wasn't a leaderboard mod until Quilt started. But I was thr for lk a month b4 Quilt came on. That was when most of the stuff was hppn-, a lot of world records. I actually stepped down somewhat recently, though I still own the Minecraft Speedrun Discord.

nncheat: Well, I thk I was j a lil bit modd- and then I got sidetracked to making a ?? API, got stuck and stopped doing it. I was mainly in Quilt and Fabric gv- tech supt. E day I sat in the train and help- ppl with tech supt. Tt's mostly for Quilt and w regards to modding.

nnkrop: Making MC datapacks, exploring Kotlin, and stuff.

nnaurora: I wld say... Good qn... I wrote a mod, I was ctrb- to Fabric, esp the Resource Loader. O/w I was work- on Aurora's Decorations and my mods. So yeah, not rly much to say.

nnax: I did a lil bit of work for Fabric loader, but mostly it's just BC. Tt's abt it. 

nngdu: nnsnz?

nnmango, nngdu: Snooze is snoozing.

nngdu: Idth he can use his mic atm. Yeah, go ahead and type tt. Hehe, don't say the "Dream" word.

pgsnz: "I was doing animation"

nngdu: Tt's totally fair, tt's dfcl stuff tt. I blv tt brings us to the end of the list. Is thr ath tt aone wants to bring up here?

nncheat: I wanna giv a big shoutout to nngli for power- thru last week. He did a great job and it's lk a big part of the rsn we're here now at this t.

nngdu: He has done a great job, I agree. Hope[[ he feels btr soon.

nncheta: ??? I thk he worked on fapi q a bit, if I'm not mistaken.

nngdu: yeah, imn it's been a ridiculous= Ig it's been a year since we went public w the server, and it's kinda insane to see the amt of effort tt ppl put in. You guys don't see the dev chnls whr ppl put in depth what they're gg to work on. It's rly helped to form the direction of the proj since then. It's been rly great to work with the dev team, they've been rly fanta as well. And esp the comy too.

nncheat: Incl yslf tho, pls.

nngdu: I can't blow my own horn too loudly, but ty. Eone who's worked on the comy, or even if you've been here to show supt, you're why we're here, and why we've reached here. Alrt eone, we're at hte end of our list , and I'm emo[ burned out. Thx for eone for turning- up. We hv recorded this, tho I'm not sure how this will turn out.

nncheat: If aone has any more qns they think of during the week, Sat is our next dev mtg. Beta rls wld hv calmed down a bit by then. It's on the Tlcn Server, `#toolchain=general`. You'll find a link on the Tlcn Server.

nncheat: In dev]=mtg trad, join us in `#voice`for the after party.

???: Thx,

???: Bye.
